                           CITADEL GAIM PLUGIN V0.3
                           ========================

                         Copyright © 2006 David Given

INTRODUCTION
============

Gaim-Citadel is a plugin for Gaim that allows you to connect to the Citadel
groupware suite. It enables you to see who else is logged in to the Citadel
server, and to communicate with them via instant messages (pages in Citadel
terminology).

Needless to say, you need Gaim to make this work. You also need access to
a Citadel server to connect to.

INSTALLATION
============

Gaim-Citadel depends on the following software:

	gaim: currently, Gaim-Citadel only works on Gaim 1.5. It may work on
	    2.0, but it has not been tested.
	
	lua 5.0: available from http://www.lua.org/download.html.

    tolua 5.0: available from http://www.tecgraf.puc-rio.br/~celes/tolua.

Gaim-Citadel uses Prime Mover as its build tool. To build, do:

    ./pm

This will compile Gaim-Citadel and install it into your ~/.gaim directory.
The installation directory and other aspects of the build process are
configurable by editing pmfile; the configuration variables are defined
near the top and should be self-explanatory.

USING GAIM-CITADEL
==================

Once installed, Gaim should see the plugin automatically. You can now tell
Gaim about your Citadel account.

There are three special settings (in the Extra Options section of the
account preferences page):

    Use TLS
        Tells the plugin to use encryption when connecting to the Citadel
        server. Defaults to on. STRONGLY RECOMMENDED! If you don't have
        this set, your password will be sent in the clear across the
        internet.
        
    Everyone's a buddy
        Citadel is commonly used for fairly small groups of people, all
        of whom know each other. Setting this option causes everybody
        seen on the Citadel server to be automatically added to your
        buddy list.
    
    Polling interval
        The Citadel server protocol does not directly support
        asynchronous presence updates. This means that Gaim has to repeatedly
        poll the server to find out who's currently online. This setting
        lets you control how often this happens (in seconds). For LAN
        environments, 30 is probably appropriate. For servers across the
        internet, leave it at 60 (the default).

SUPPORT
=======

Gaim-Citadel was written by me, David Given and is not officially endorsed by
the authors of the Citadel groupware suite. However, the best place to get
support is probably on the official Citadel Support forum. This can be found
on the Uncensored Citadel BBS. You can sign up for free by visiting:

    http://uncensored.citadel.org

My handle there is hjalfi. And yes, Gaim-Citadel works on Uncensored.
