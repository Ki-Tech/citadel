 
           Description of the files in the "netconfigs" directory

 These files contain a set of network configurations for a room.  They are
stored in the directory $BBSDIR/netconfigs and are named according to each
room's internal ID number.  When a room is deleted, its network configuration
file is deleted as well.
  
 The configuration file contains one or more lines of text, each line
containing a configuration option.  These lines may specify message pointers,
room sharing instructions, mailing list recipients, etc.  Fields are separated
by the vertical bar character ("|") and there will always be at least one
field on each line.
