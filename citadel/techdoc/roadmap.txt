This isn't an official list of plans.  It's basically just some notes on where
we want to be going.  It's something to consult when sitting down to write
some code and deciding what to work on.


Goals to achieve during the 6.xx cycle
--------------------------------------

* Address books: allow personal address books as well as global, and give
  the system the ability to use those addresses as e-mail shortcuts.
 
* Better UI presentation for delegated access to mailboxes.

* Optimize the IMAP server.
  Status: as of 6.12 we are completely functional.  Even the SEARCH command
  works now.  We still have to make it run faster, though.

* LDAP directory support

* Calendar service
  Status: full functionality is present in 6.07, including the ability to
  keep a calendar, send/receive invitations, manage attendees, etc.  You
  need to use WebCit to access it, though.  We are now waiting for an open
  source, cross platform, professional quality calendar client to emerge.
  Once this happens, we will connect it to Citadel.  Or we might want to
  select a protocol (such as WCAP or CAP) and implement it.

* NNTP
  This needs some research, but I think it's technically going to be more
  trouble than it's worth. -IO
