This isn't an official list of plans.  It's basically just some notes on where
we want to be going.  It's something to consult when sitting down to write
some code and deciding what to work on.


Goals to achieve during the 6.xx cycle
--------------------------------------

* Address books: the current implementation has both a 'Contacts' personal
  folder and a 'Global Address Book' -- both which contain vCards.  Add more
  places where these addresses can be pulled in and used.
 
* Better UI presentation for delegated access to mailboxes.  (In IMAP this
  will be easy because of "other users namespace" support.)

* Additional LDAP integration

* Calendar service
  Status: full functionality is present in 6.07, including the ability to
  keep a calendar, send/receive invitations, manage attendees, etc.  You
  need to use WebCit to access it, though.  We are now waiting for an open
  source, cross platform, professional quality calendar client to emerge.
  Once this happens, we will connect it to Citadel.  Or we might want to
  select a protocol (such as WCAP or CAP) and implement it.
  (UPDATE: the new 'Kolab' groupware system is using a Citadel-like calendar
  store, i.e. vCalendar objects accessed through IMAP.  We are now aiming
  for full Kolab compatibility, as there are at least two more client projects
  which are doing the same, and hopefully we can evolve the Kolab spec into
  an open groupware standard.)

* NNTP
  This needs some research, but I think it's technically going to be more
  trouble than it's worth. -IO

 
 Short-term TODO list
 --------------------
 
 * PLAIN and CRAM-MD5 authentication mechanisms
 * WebCit support for HTTP transactions performed by Kolab clients
