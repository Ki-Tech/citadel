This isn't an official list of plans.  It's basically just some notes on where
we want to be going.  It's something to consult when sitting down to write
some code and deciding what to work on.


Goals to achieve during the 6.xx cycle
--------------------------------------

* Address books: allow personal address books as well as global, and give
  the system the ability to use those addresses as e-mail shortcuts.
 
* Better UI presentation for delegated access to mailboxes.

* Optimize the IMAP server and add the search command.
  Mozilla/Netscape makes this query:
7 UID fetch 1662,1750,1774,2788:2790 (UID RFC822.SIZE FLAGS BODY.PEEK[HEADER.FIELDS (From To Cc Subject Date Message-ID Priority X-Priority References Newsgroups)])
  Outbreak makes this query:
000W UID FETCH 1:* (BODY.PEEK[HEADER.FIELDS
(References X-Ref X-Priority X-MSMail-Priority X-MSOESRec Newsgroups)] ENVELOPE
RFC822.SIZE UID FLAGS INTERNALDATE)

* LDAP directory support

* Calendar service

* NNTP
