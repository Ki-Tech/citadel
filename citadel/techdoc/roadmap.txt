This isn't an official list of plans.  It's basically just some notes on where
we want to be going.  It's something to consult when sitting down to write
some code and deciding what to work on.


 Recent goals achieved (in tree, not necessarily published yet)
 --------------------------------------------------------------

* GroupDAV and "webcal" (icalendar over dav) support
* Updated schema for publishing Citadel address book data into an
  external LDAP directory (still awaiting enterprise number from IANA)
* Internationalization (WebCit is now available in several languages.)

 Goals to achieve during the 7.xx cycle
 --------------------------------------

* Aliases, virtual addresses, and distribution lists
  (We ought to be able to handle all three of these using the same facility.)

* CalDAV support (eventually -- since the protocol is so ugly and needlessly
  complex, the draft authors are still arguing over small details -- once the
  draft is finalized, we will implement enough of CalDAV to support the two
  major client packages currently using it)

* Integration of CMS and social software features (more on this later).

* Further internationalization (for example, in the citserver).

* Per-user auto-handling of inbound mail.  Simple handlers such as an "out
  of office reply" should be easy for users to set up.  More complex handlers
  such as the automatic sorting of inbound mail into various folders based
  on sender, subject, etc. should also be possible.

* Address books: build dialogs to integrate personal address books into
  mail recipient boxes, auto-completion, etc.  Use AJAX for this.

* Better UI presentation for delegated access to mailboxes.  (In IMAP this
  will be easy because of "other users namespace" support.)
