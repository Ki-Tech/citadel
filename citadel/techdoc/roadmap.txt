This isn't an official list of plans.  It's basically just some notes on where
we want to be going.  It's something to consult when sitting down to write
some code and deciding what to work on.


Goals to achieve during the 6.xx cycle
--------------------------------------

* Address books

  Status: the current implementation has both a 'Contacts' personal
  folder and a 'Global Address Book' -- both which contain vCards.  WebCit
  can use them, and Kolab-compatible clients seem to be able to access them
  seamlessly as well.
 
  We should integrate the address books more tightly into Citadel dialogs
  such as recipient auto-completion, etc.
 
* Better UI presentation for delegated access to mailboxes.  (In IMAP this
  will be easy because of "other users namespace" support.)

* Additional LDAP integration
 
  Status: the current implementation can populate an external LDAP directory
  with Citadel user data.

* Calendar service
 
  Status: full functionlity is present in the current implementation, including
  the ability to keep a personal calendar, send/receive invitations, manage
  attendees, check free/busy times, etc.  It is fully usable via WebCit
  and also works with Kolab-compatible clients (vCalendar over IMAP for the
  calendar store, and vCalendar over HTTPS for checking other users' free/busy
  times).
 
  Doing CAP or WCAP seems less important now that vCalendar-over-IMAP seems
  to be the emerging standard for open source groupware.  We will monitor the
  direction the community takes and follow along.
  
* NNTP
  This needs some research, but I think it's technically going to be more
  trouble than it's worth. -IO

 
 Short-term TODO list
 --------------------
 
 * PLAIN and CRAM-MD5 authentication mechanisms
   (Status: PLAIN is done; CRAM-MD5 will arrive a little later.)

 * WebCit support for HTTP transactions performed by Kolab clients
   (Status: DONE!  The current WebCit build works with the KDE Kolab klient
   using HTTPS.)
