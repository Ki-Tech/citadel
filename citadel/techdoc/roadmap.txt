This isn't an official list of plans.  It's basically just some notes on where
we want to be going.  It's something to consult when sitting down to write
some code and deciding what to work on.


 Recent goals achieved (in tree, not necessarily published yet)
 --------------------------------------------------------------

* GroupDAV and "webcal" (icalendar over dav) support
* Updated schema for publishing Citadel address book data into an
  external LDAP directory
* Internationalization (WebCit is now available in several languages.)
* Per-user auto-handling of inbound mail.  (Sieve + rules editor)


 Goals to achieve during the 7.xx cycle
 --------------------------------------

* CalDAV support (Eventually.  Since both the protocol itself and the people
  designing it are incredibly ugly, it keeps changing, and implementations
  keep breaking.  When the spec is finalized, we will implement enough of
  CalDAV to provide compatibility with any major client packages which use
  it.)

* Integration of CMS and social software features (more on this later).

* Further internationalization (for example, in the citserver).

* Address books: build dialogs to integrate personal address books into
  mail recipient boxes, auto-completion, etc.  Use AJAX for this.

* Better UI presentation for delegated access to mailboxes.  (In IMAP this
  will be easy because of "other users namespace" support.)


 Miscellaneous "wish list" items
 -------------------------------

* Smart callback hook mechanism reducing traffic between citadel and the Database
  to do things like:
  * Alarms. Trigger popups etc. for users via the chat-keepalive
  * Chat. don't query the db on and on for this. 
  * Modify a list of rooms with new items for the logged in users to do things like:
    * Print the number of new mails onto the Webcit menu
    * change the roomlist / treeview according to new unread messages in the rooms

* bright new world to the tui too!
  * Calendar mechanism
  * vcards...

* more persistant css usage in webcit

* backtraces in the log in case of panics, etc.

* auto-login should move from compile to installtime.

* scheduled restarts there should be a way to notify all users 
   (whether via imap or webcit) that citadel is going to be unavailable.
   
* there should be a way to set a 'service unavailable because of' message, 
  for people connecting via webcit, so they can see this is a scheduled 
  downtime (so they don't take further actions like anoying the admin
  (you) via phone or restart citadel...

* there should be a way to keep citadel from starting while you're db recovering etc.
  (perhaps something like the pre-shutdown state would be cool, with a 
   message? so you tell it "sysadmin is reworking the database" as param
   to the server, it will close the db, but keep open the port, and 
   print out your message as error message. this should last until citserver
   receives a kill signal, and then terminates.)

* citserver should bypass some bdb errors and symptoms. it should remember 
  the actual berkeley db version in its state file, and in case of an up/downgrade
  moan this to the user / logfile. bdb upgrades should trigger a mail to aide.

* easy management of external room access. there should be a gui way for room aliases.

* backcheck of aliases. citadel must check, if on save of the aliases there will be a 
  race between other users / users aliases. 
  -> citadel must check while saving the aliases, if the mail delivers yet to another 
     person than the one just saving the aliases. if yes, it should do something like 
     mail to foo@bar.org is already delivered to joeblow@bar.org

* uid to name in webcit / imap; citadel shouldn't display something like uid.room
  to other users, if they share it to others. it should do something like username/room
  where username should be a floor.

* webcit should be made more resistant to html injections, especialy the chat window.
