This isn't an official list of plans.  It's basically just some notes on where
we want to be going.  It's something to consult when sitting down to write
some code and deciding what to work on.


Goals for 5.90
--------------
* New networker (done)
* Database enhancements (done)


Goals for 6.00
--------------
* Multiple recipients allowed in Citadel protocol.  Rework the code to feed
  all deliveries through the same set of functions, regardless of whether a
  message is submitted through Citadel protocol, SMTP, or from the networker.
  (Done.  Needs to be tested more extensively.)

* Optimize the IMAP server and add the search command
* Get the Global Address Book working
* LDAP directory support?


Goals for beyond 6.00
---------------------
* Calendar server
* Address book server
* Integration with Evolution, Mozilla Calendar, etc.
