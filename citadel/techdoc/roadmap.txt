This isn't an official list of plans.  It's basically just some notes on where
we want to be going.  It's something to consult when sitting down to write
some code and deciding what to work on.


Goals to achieve during the 6.xx cycle
--------------------------------------

* Address books: allow personal address books as well as global, and give
  the system the ability to use those addresses as e-mail shortcuts.
 
* Better UI presentation for delegated access to mailboxes.

* Optimize the IMAP server and add the search command.
  Status: as of 6.06 we are working smoothly with many popular IMAP clients
  on several platforms.  Still need to add SEARCH command.

* LDAP directory support

* Calendar service
  Status: full functionality is present in 6.07, including the ability to
  keep a calendar, send/receive invitations, manage attendees, etc.  You
  need to use WebCit to access it, though.  The next step will be to write
  connector software for various external calendar clients.

* NNTP
