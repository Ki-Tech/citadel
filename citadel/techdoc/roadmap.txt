This isn't an official list of plans.  It's basically just some notes on where
we want to be going.  It's something to consult when sitting down to write
some code and deciding what to work on.


Goals for 5.90
--------------
* New networker (done)
* Database enhancements (done)


Goals for 6.00
--------------
* Multiple recipients allowed in Citadel protocol.  Rework the code to feed
  all deliveries through the same set of functions, regardless of whether a
  message is submitted through Citadel protocol, SMTP, or from the networker.
  (Completed in 5.91)

* Get the Global Address Book working
  (Completed in 5.91, needs more polish on the UI side, though)
 
* Delegations
  (Access controls complete in 5.91.  Need better presentation before 6.00)

* Optimize the IMAP server and add the search command.
  Mozilla/Netscape makes this query:
7 UID fetch 1662,1750,1774,2788:2790 (UID RFC822.SIZE FLAGS BODY.PEEK[HEADER.FIELDS (From To Cc Subject Date Message-ID Priority X-Priority References Newsgroups)])
  Outbreak makes this query:
000W UID FETCH 1:* (BODY.PEEK[HEADER.FIELDS
(References X-Ref X-Priority X-MSMail-Priority X-MSOESRec Newsgroups)] ENVELOPE
RFC822.SIZE UID FLAGS INTERNALDATE)

* Nested folders ... at least in IMAP
  (done)

* "Views" (presentation hints for WebCit etc.)
  (mostly done)


Goals for beyond 6.00
---------------------
* LDAP directory support?
* Calendar server
* Address book server
* Integration with Evolution, Mozilla Calendar, etc.
* NNTP
