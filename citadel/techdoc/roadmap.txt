This isn't an official list of plans.  It's basically just some notes on where
we want to be going.  It's something to consult when sitting down to write
some code and deciding what to work on.


Goals for 5.90
--------------
* New networker (done)
* Database enhancements (done)


Goals for 6.00
--------------
* Multiple recipients allowed in Citadel protocol.  Rework the code to feed
  all deliveries through the same set of functions, regardless of whether a
  message is submitted through Citadel protocol, SMTP, or from the networker.
  (Done.)

* Get the Global Address Book working (Done, just need some polish)

* Optimize the IMAP server and add the search command.
  Netscape makes this query:
7 UID fetch 1662,1750,1774,2788:2790 (UID RFC822.SIZE FLAGS BODY.PEEK[HEADER.FIELDS (From To Cc Subject Date Message-ID Priority X-Priority References Newsgroups)])
  Microsoft VirusSpreader makes this query:
000W UID FETCH 1:* (BODY.PEEK[HEADER.FIELDS
(References X-Ref X-Priority X-MSMail-Priority X-MSOESRec Newsgroups)] ENVELOPE
RFC822.SIZE UID FLAGS INTERNALDATE)

* Nested folders ... at least in IMAP

* LDAP directory support?


Goals for beyond 6.00
---------------------
* Calendar server
* Address book server
* Integration with Evolution, Mozilla Calendar, etc.
* NNTP
