This isn't an official list of plans.  It's basically just some notes on where
we want to be going.  It's something to consult when sitting down to write
some code and deciding what to work on.


Goals to achieve during the 6.xx cycle
--------------------------------------

* Address books: allow personal address books as well as global, and give
  the system the ability to use those addresses as e-mail shortcuts.
 
* Better UI presentation for delegated access to mailboxes.

* LDAP directory support
  (UPDATE: an LDAP connector for Citadel has been checked into CVS, and it
  is capable of populating an external LDAP directory.)

* Calendar service
  Status: full functionality is present in 6.07, including the ability to
  keep a calendar, send/receive invitations, manage attendees, etc.  You
  need to use WebCit to access it, though.  We are now waiting for an open
  source, cross platform, professional quality calendar client to emerge.
  Once this happens, we will connect it to Citadel.  Or we might want to
  select a protocol (such as WCAP or CAP) and implement it.
  (UPDATE: the new 'Kolab' groupware system is using a Citadel-like calendar
  store, i.e. vCalendar objects accessed through IMAP.  We are now aiming
  for full Kolab compatibility, as there are at least two more client projects
  which are doing the same, and hopefully we can evolve the Kolab spec into
  an open groupware standard.)

* NNTP
  This needs some research, but I think it's technically going to be more
  trouble than it's worth. -IO

 
 Short-term TODO list
 --------------------
 
 * STARTTLS support in IMAP, POP, and SMTP
 * PLAIN and CRAM-MD5 authentication mechanisms
 * WebCit support for HTTP transactions performed by Kolab clients
