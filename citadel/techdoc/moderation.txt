 TECHNICAL DISCUSSION OF THE CITADEL/UX MODERATION SYSTEM
 
 Starting with version ?.??, the Citadel system supports moderation of
messages.  This is used for both internal processing and for the more
traditional filtering purposes.
 
 The central design thrust behind this design is to maximize the
"signal to noise ratio" while minimizing "censorship."  Users may choose to
filter at a very low threshold, reading everything, or at a higher threshold,
reading only selected messages.
 
 Each message now carries a moderation level in its supplementary message base
record (smi.smi_mod).  This is an 8-bit signed integer with values ranging from
-127 to 127.  The following standards apply:


	LEVEL		PURPOSE

	-127		"System overhead" message.  These should never be
			shown to users.  An overhead message might contain
			the room's network configuration or something to that
			effect.  (Not yet implemented, but we probably will
			do it this way.)

	-100		Deleted message.  Aides might choose to browse deleted
			messages, un-deleting them if appropriate.

	-63 to +63	Normal user-mode messages.  All messages start out at
			level 0 when first posted (or when no supplementary
			message base record exists).


 On a typical hobbyist BBS with a small administrative staff, most messages
will remain at level 0, with perhaps the off-topic ones getting moderated
to -1 or -2, providing the less tolerant users with a way of avoiding reading
through drivel.
 
 On a very large system with many active moderators, there might be a high
level of activity involving moderating _up_ the messages that are the most
poignant or pertinent.  In this case, users might choose to filter at a level
higher than 0, seeing only the messages that someone decided were worth
reading.
