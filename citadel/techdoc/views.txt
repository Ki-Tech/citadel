How "views" work in Citadel (beginning with v6.00)
--------------------------------------------------
 
 (Note: this stuff isn't finished yet; we're still building the framework.)
 
 There's no need to be rigid and stupid about how different rooms are presented
in a Citadel client.  And we don't enforce things either.  But there's a need
to make things look the way the user wants to see them.  For example, we might
always choose to see a room full of private mail as a summary (one line per
message) rather than always dumping out the entire contents like we do on a
typical BBS room.  An address book room might look better as a tabbed view
or something, rather than as a bunch of messages with vCards attached to them.

 This is why we define "views" for a room.  It gives the client software a
hint as to how to display the contents of a room.  This is kept on a per-user
basis by storing it in the 'visit' record for a particular room/user
combination.  It is visit.v_view and is an integer.  Naturally, there also
needs to be a default, for users who have never visited the room before.  This
is in the room record as room.QRdefaultview (and is also an integer).
 
 The values currently defined are:

#define	VIEW_BBS		0	/* Traditional Citadel BBS view */
#define VIEW_MAILBOX		1	/* Mailbox summary */
#define VIEW_ADDRESSBOOK	2	/* Address book view */
#define VIEW_CALENDAR		3	/* Calendar view */
#define VIEW_TASKS		4	/* Tasks view */
#define VIEW_NOTES		5	/* Notes view */
