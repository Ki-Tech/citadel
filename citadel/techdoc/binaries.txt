Notes on building a set of portable binaries
--------------------------------------------

This is kind of a work in progress.  Here's what we've done so far to 
build a portable tarball.  We keep all the stuff that Citadel needs, but
is not part of Citadel itself, in /usr/local/ctdlsupport, and we keep
Citadel in /usr/local/citadel.  (This is only known to work on Linux+GCC.)

We build in /usr/src.

1. Build Berkeley DB with:
 
 ../dist/configure --prefix=/usr/local/ctdlsupport
 make
 make install

2. Build libical with:
 
 ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/ctdlsupport
 make
 make install
 
 (FIXME still not detected properly)

3. Set these environment variables for the rest of the build:
export CFLAGS='-I/usr/local/ctdlsupport/include'
export CPPFLAGS='-I/usr/local/ctdlsupport/include'
export LDFLAGS='-L/usr/local/ctdlsupport/lib -Wl,--rpath -Wl,/usr/local/ctdlsupport/lib'
 
 -L tells the build system where to find libraries during the build process,
while -Wl,--rpath inserts that same library path into the Citadel binaries
so they know where to find the libs at runtime.  Since we can't depend on
the correct version of Berkeley DB already being on the system, this is how
we carry our own along.  It's better than static linking everything.

4. If LDAP support is required, build OpenLDAP with:

./configure --prefix=/usr/local/citadel --with-db=/usr/local/ctdlsupport
make
make depend
make install

5. Build Citadel with:

./configure --prefix=/usr/local/citadel --with-db=/usr/local/ctdlsupport
make
make install

6. Build WebCit with:

./configure --prefix=/usr/local/webcit
make
make install
 
 FIXME / TODO
 
 -- Repair libical integration
 -- Add newt to the supplied libraries
 -- Possibly add curses to the supplied libraries
 -- Maybe even add openssl to the supplied libraries
 -- Write the web-based installer.
