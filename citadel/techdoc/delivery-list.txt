Description of the custom MIME type "application/x-citadel-delivery-list"

 This MIME type may be found in the outbound queue room on Citadel systems,
which is typically called "__CitadelSMTPspoolout__".  The room is flagged as
private, but we will eventually hide it even to Aides.  
 
 Messages in this format contain delivery instructions.  Therefore, for each
message in the queue to be delivered to one or more recipients, there will be
*two* messages in the room: one containing the actual message, and the other
containing delivery instructions.  It is expected that the instructions
message may be replaced at any time (using an Extended ID field) if delivery
to only some of the recipients has been accomplished.
 
 Citadel keeps reference counts of each message on disk.  Therefore if a
message contains a mixture of local and remote recipients, there may be two
or more references to the message itself, one of them being the one in the
queue.
  
 A delivery list contains one or more lines of text, each line containing
a single instruction (usually a recipient).  Fields are separated by the
vertical bar character ("|") and there will always be at least one field on
each line.
 
 
 
 INSTRUCTION:  msgid
 SYNTAX:       msgid|0000000
 DESCRIPTION:  
    Defines the actual message for which we are providing delivery
    instructions.  This instruction must precede all the others.  When
    all deliveries have either succeeded or failed, both the instructions and
    the copy of the message itself in the queue room should be deleted.  The
    second parameter specifies the message ID in the local database.
 
 
 INSTRUCTION:  local
 SYNTAX:       local|Friko Mumjiboolean|0
 DESCRIPTION:
    Indicates the name of a recipient on the local system to which the
    message must be delivered.  Almost never seen because most code delivers
    directly.
 
 
 INSTRUCTION:  room
 SYNTAX:       room|Lobby|0
 DESCRIPTION:
    Indicates the name of a room on the local system to which the message
    must be copied.  Same implications as 'local'.
 
 
 INSTRUCTION:  remote
 SYNTAX:       remote|billg@microsoft.com|0
 DESCRIPTION:
    Names a recipient on a remote system to which the message should be
    delivered.  (FIX ... this is where we have to keep track of multiple
    delivery attempts and transient errors)
 
 
 INSTRUCTION:  ignet
 SYNTAX:       ignet|uncnsrd|Lobby|0
 DESCRIPTION:
    Names a room on another Citadel node to which this message needs to be
    spooled over the network.
