              NETWORK CONFIGURATION UTILITIES FOR CITADEL/UX
              ----------------------------------------------
 
 ABSTRACT
 --------
 
 The Citadel/UX system now comes with two utilities for managing room-sharing
with other systems: 'netsetup' (a command line utility) and 'dnetsetup' (a
curses-based front end to netsetup).  Read on for more detail...
  
  
 THE NETSETUP PROGRAM
 --------------------
 
 'netsetup' is a program which eliminates the need to edit the files in your
network/systems directory in order to maintain the sharing of rooms on a
network.  It allows you to make all changes from the command line.  While the
program is quite usable and straightforward this way, the real objective is
for it to be controlled by any of several user-friendly front ends (such as
the 'dnetsetup' program, described below).  The usage of 'netsetup' is as
follows:
  
 netsetup: usage: netsetup <command> [arguments]
 
 Commands: 
   nodelist                  (Lists all neighboring nodes)
   addnode [name]            (Adds a new node to the list)
   deletenode [name]         (Deletes a node from the list)
   roomlist [node]           (List rooms being shared)
   getcommand [node]         (Show spool command)
   setcommand [node] [cmd]   (Set spool command)
   share [node] [room]       (Add a new shared room)
   unshare [node] [room]     (Stop sharing a room)
   help                      (Display this message)
  
  The usage of each command should be quite straightforward from the
descriptions listed here.
 
 
 THE DNETSETUP PROGRAM
 ---------------------
 
 dnetsetup is a more user-friendly front end to netsetup.  It's written in
shell-script and requires no compiling.  Simply type 'dnetsetup' at the
command line and follow the menus to create, edit, and delete neighboring
network nodes, and to share and unshare rooms.
