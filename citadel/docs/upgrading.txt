 
 UPGRADING AN EXISTING CITADEL/UX INSTALLATION
 ---------------------------------------------
 
 The process by which you will upgrade an older version of Citadel/UX to the
current one depends on which version you have installed.
 
  
 
 Version 1.xx, 2.xx, or 3.xx
 ---------------------------
 
 Upgrading from these versions is no longer supported.  Sorry.
 
 
 
 Version 4.xx, 5.0x, or 5.1x
 ---------------------------
 
 Obtain the "export5" utility from any FTP site which carries Citadel.  This
package contains instructions on how to 'export' your old databases, and then
'import' them into Citadel/UX 5.54.
 
 NOTE: if you have any of these versions installed, you must first upgrade
to Citadel/UX v5.54, and then upgrade from 5.54 to the latest version.  The
file formats for 5.60 have changed drastically, and it is unfeasible to build
a one-step migration path.
 
 
  
 Version 5.50 thru 5.69
 ----------------------
 
 Upgrading from 5.50 and up is easy.  Unpack the source and run the
configure script using "--with-prefix=/your/citadel/directory" just like you
had done for the previous version.  After the compile is finished, shut down
the running copy of citserver and do a "make install-exec".  This command
installs the new programs without overwriting any of your data files, system
banners, or anything else.
 
 
 
 
 All versions up to 5.69
 -----------------------
 
 After you upgrade, you MUST run "setup" before starting citserver!  If you do
not do so, the server will notice the older version stamp on your data files
and refuse to run.  Run setup, then start citserver.
  
  
  
 Versions 5.70 and up
 --------------------
 
 No special action is necessary.  Just compile the code, make install-exec, and start
up the Citadel server again.  The server will recognize what you are doing and perform
some database upgrades internally during startup.
