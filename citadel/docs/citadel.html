<pre>Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.  <br>59 Temple Place - Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307, USA<br><br>Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br>of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br></pre>

<div align="justify">  </div>
                         
<p align="justify">   The licenses for most software are designed to take 
      away your freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General 
    Public  License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change 
    free software--to  make sure the software is free for all its users. 
This    General Public License  applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's 
    software and to any other  program whose authors commit to using it. 
(Some    other Free Software Foundation  software is covered by the GNU Library
 General   Public License instead.)  You can apply it to your programs, too.
  </p>
                         
<div align="justify"> </div>
                         
<p align="justify">    When we speak of free software, we are referring to 
      freedom, not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make 
  sure    that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software 
(and  charge    for this service if you wish), that you receive source code 
or can get it   if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces 
 of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.  </p>
                         
<div align="justify"> </div>
                         
<p align="justify">   To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions 
      that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender 
   the   rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities 
for   you  if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it. 
 </p>
                         
<div align="justify"> </div>
                         
<p align="justify">   For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, 
      whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights 
     that you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get 
 the     source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their 
 rights.      </p>
                         
<div align="justify"> </div>
                         
<p align="justify">   We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright 
      the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission
      to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.  </p>
                         
<div align="justify"> </div>
                         
<p align="justify">   Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want 
      to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty 
for    this  free software.  If the software is modified by someone else and
passed    on,  we want its recipients to know that what they have is not
the original,    so  that any problems introduced by others will not reflect
on the original     authors' reputations.   </p>
                         
<div align="justify"> </div>
                         
<p align="justify">   Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by
software patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program
proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any  patent must
be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.  </p>

<p align="justify">  <strong>0.</strong>  This License applies to any program 
      or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder 
 saying     it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License.
   The   "Program", below, refers to any such program or work, and a "work
 based  on  the Program" means either the Program or any derivative work
under  copyright    law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or
a portion  of it, either   verbatim or with modifications and/or translated 
into another  language.   (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation 
in the  term "modification".)    Each licensee is addressed as "you". </p>
                         
<p align="justify">  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification 
      are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act 
  of   running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
    is   covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program
   (independent   of having been made by running the Program). Whether that
  is true depends   on what the Program does.  </p>
                         
<p align="justify">  <strong>1.</strong>  You may copy and distribute verbatim 
      copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, 
  provided    that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy 
  an appropriate    copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact 
  all the notices    that refer to this License and to the absence of any 
warranty;  and give  any  other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along  with the  Program.  </p>
                         
<p align="justify">  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring 
      a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange 
     for a fee. </p>
                         
<p align="justify">  <strong>2.</strong>  You may modify your copy or copies 
      of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the 
  Program,    and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the 
 terms of Section    1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

as a whole at  no charge   to all third      parties under the terms of this
License.

  reads    commands  interactively      when run, you must cause it, when
started  running   for such      interactive use in the most ordinary way,
to print  or display   an       announcement including an appropriate copyright
notice  and a      notice  that there is no warranty (or else, saying that
you provide       a warranty)  and that users may redistribute the program
under      these   conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of
this      License.    (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
     does not normally   print such an announcement, your work based on 
    the Program is not required   to print  an announcement.) </li>
                         
</ul>
               These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.
 If  identifiable     sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
 and can be reasonably     considered independent and separate works in themselves,
  then this License,     and its terms, do not apply to those sections when
  you distribute them  as   separate works.  But when you distribute the
same   sections as part of  a whole  which is a work based on the Program,
the distribution  of the whole   must be on the terms of this License, whose
permissions for  other licensees   extend  to the entire whole, and thus
to each and every  part regardless of  who wrote  it. </div>
                         
<p align="justify">  Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights

is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective

<p align="justify">  In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based

               The source code for a work means the preferred form of the

source   code   means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus 
any associated     interface  definition files, plus the scripts used to control
compilation     and installation  of the executable.  However, as a special
exception,  the   source code distributed  need not include anything that
is normally  distributed   (in either source or binary form) with the major
components  (compiler, kernel,   and so on) of the operating system on which
the executable  runs, unless that  component itself  accompanies the executable.

<h3>Overview</h3>
                       
<p>Citadel/UX is an advanced, multiuser, client/server, room-based BBS program. 
      It is designed to handle the needs of both small dialup systems and 
large-scale     Internet-connected systems.  It was originally developed on
an Altos system     running Xenix, and has been installed and tested on various
Unix and Unix-like     platforms.  The author's current development environment
(and BBS) is an   ordinary Linux system.  The current distribution includes:
</p>
                     
<ul>
            <li>The Citadel/UX server (this is the back end that does all 
processing)        </li>
             <li>A text-based client program designed with the traditional
 Citadel     "look  and feel" (room prompts, dot commands, and the like)
  </li>
             <li>Setup programs </li>
             <li>A set of utilities for system administration and maintenance 
    </li>
             <li>Documentation </li>
                     
</ul>
                        
<p>Some knowledge of the Unix system is necessary to install and manage the
      system. It is mandatory that the sysop have "root" access to the operating
      system. The following are required to install Citadel/UX: </p>
                     
<ul>
            <li>A Unix operating system (Linux, BSD, Solaris, Tru64, HP/UX) 
   </li>
             <li>C compiler (such as gcc or egcs) and "make" </li>
             <li>POSIX threads (the "pthreads" library) </li>
             <li>TCP/IP </li>
             <li><a href="http://www.sleepycat.com">Berkeley DB</a> v4.1
or  newer    (GDBM  also works, but its use is officially depracated.  If
you  are building    a new system, do <i>not</i> use GDBM.  If you have an
existing  system which    uses GDBM, you should migrate it to Berkeley DB
as soon as  possible.) </li>
             <li>Enough disk space to hold all of the programs and data </li>
                     
</ul>
                         
<p>If you are running Citadel/UX on a Linux system, it is STRONGLY recommended
      that you run it on a recent distribution (such as  <a
 href="http://www.redhat.com">Red Hat</a> 7.3 or newer).  A new-ish distribution 
     will have most or all of the prerequisite tools and libraries already 
 integrated    for you.</p>
                             
<h3>Now available:</h3>
                        
<ul>
            <li>"WebCit", a gateway program to allow full access to Citadel 
 via   the  World Wide Web.  Interactive access through any Web browser. 
 </li>
             <li>Access to Citadel via <i>any</i> standards-compliant e-mail
  program,   thanks  to Citadel's built-in SMTP, POP, and IMAP services.
&nbsp;You   can  use Netscape/Mozilla, Evolution, Eudora, Pine, or even Microsoft
VirusSpreader    (better known as "Outlook") with Citadel. </li>
                     
</ul>
                         
<h3>Coming soon:</h3>
                       
<ul>
            <li>Newer and better GUI-based clients. </li>
                     
</ul>
                      
<h3><a name="Everything_in_its_place..."></a>Everything in its place...</h3>
                      
<p>Hopefully you've unpacked the distribution archive into its own directory.
     This is the directory in which all Citadel files are located and in
which      all activity will take place.  Several subdirectories have already
been    created  during the unpacking process, and others may be created
by the  software  if  needed.  Make sure you have Berkeley DB installed on
your system,  and  that  you have all the development libraries and headers
in place so  that  you can  compile against them.  If you don't, you can
get the latest  Berkeley   DB at  <a href="http://www.sleepycat.com">http://www.sleepycat.com</a>.
   If your  operating system uses a separate library to support POSIX threads
   (pthreads),  make sure that library is installed as well.  This is almost
   never the case  with Linux, but some commercial Unix flavors might need
 it.</p>
                  
<h3><a name="The_BBS_Login"></a></h3>
             
<h3>The BBS Login</h3>
                  
<p>As with many Unix programs, Citadel wants to run under its own user ID. 
    Unlike other programs, however, this user ID will do double-duty as a 
public    login for your system if you are running a BBS.  This account is 
typically    called "bbs" or "citadel" or something to that effect. You will 
tell Citadel   what the user-id of that account is, and when someone logs 
in under that  account, Citadel will prompt for a user name.</p>
                  
<p>The Citadel user should have a unique uid. The home directory should be
    the one your Citadel installation resides in (in this example we will
use    /usr/local/citadel) and the shell should be either "citadel" in that
directory,    or a script that will start up citadel (you may wish to set
up an external    text editor; see below). Example:</p>
                  
<pre>bbs::100:1:BBS Login:/usr/local/citadel:/usr/local/citadel/citadel<br></pre>
                  
<p>When you run setup later, you will be required to tell it what the Citadel 
    user's numeric user ID is, so it knows what user to run as.  If you create 
    an account called <tt>bbs</tt>, <tt>guest</tt>, or <tt>citadel</tt>, the
   setup program will automatically pick up the user ID by default.</p>
                  
<p>For all other users in /etc/passwd, Citadel will automatically set up
an account using the full name (or 'gecos' in Unixspeak) of the user.  It'll
    also ignore any password you supply, because it uses the user's password
   on the host system.  This allows a 'single sign on' type of environment.
  Note  that this does have to be enabled at compile time -- it's the configure
  option  called <tt>--enable-autologin</tt>.  Keep in mind that these users
  can use  *either* their Citadel login name or their login name on the host
  computer,  and their password on the host computer.</p>
                  
<h3><a name="Bypassing_the_login:_prompt"></a></h3>
             
<h3>Bypassing the <tt>login:</tt> prompt</h3>
                  
<p>If you normally log in to your host system using some method other than 
    telnet (such as ssh), you might want the telnet service to go straight 
 to   the Citadel BBS, instead of displaying the <tt>login:</tt> prompt first.
     You can do this by having telnetd start citadel directly instead of
<tt>/bin/login</tt>.     This is actually very simple to implement; all you
need to do is make a  simple change to your <tt>inetd</tt> or <tt>xinetd</tt>
configuration.  Here  are some configuration examples.</p>
                  
<p>An example for <tt>inetd</tt> (put the following line in <tt>/etc/inetd.conf</tt>, 
    replacing any existing telnet configuration line already there):</p>
                  
<pre>telnet stream tcp nowait root /usr/sbin/tcpd in.telnetd -L /usr/local/citadel/citadel<br></pre>
                  
<p>An example for <tt>xinetd</tt> (if you have a file called <tt>/etc/xinetd.d/telnet</tt> 
    then simply replace that file with this one):</p>
                  
<pre>service telnet<br>{<br>	flags           = REUSE<br>	socket_type     = stream<br>	wait            = no<br>	user            = root<br>	server          = /usr/sbin/in.telnetd<br>	server_args     = -L /usr/local/citadel/citadel<br>	log_on_failure  += USERID<br>	disable         = no<br>}<br></pre>
                  
<p>Please make sure you know what you're doing before you install this!  If
you are going to put Citadel somewhere other than <tt>/usr/local/citadel</tt>
    then change the directory name accordingly.  If you know of any other
local    peculiarities which need to be observed, edit the above configuration
accordingly    as well.  And, of course, if you're working remotely, make
sure you can  successfully  log in using SSH before you start changing your
telnet configuration,  otherwise  you could lock yourself out of your system
(ask any networking  specialist  about the dangers of "working inline" --
then pull up a chair  and get a fresh  cup of coffee, because you're going
to hear some war stories).</p>
                  
<h3><a name="Compiling_the_programs"></a>Compiling the programs</h3>
                  
<p>You can easily compile the Citadel system with the following commands:</p>
                  
<pre>./configure<br>make<br>make install<br></pre>
                  
<p>The 'configure' script will generate a Makefile from the Makefile.in,
and it will also write the file "sysdep.h" to your Citadel directory.  Please
    do not edit sysdep.h or Makefile.in yourself.  The configure script will
   figure out your system dependencies and set everything correctly.</p>
                  
<p>Mac OS X 10.1 and later are now supported.  (Sorry, 10.0 cannot be supported, 
   now or in the future.)  You need to install the Developer Tools CD, which 
   you can purchase or download for free from <a
 href="http://developer.apple.com">http://developer.apple.com</a>. Then run
    configure like this:</p>
                
<pre>env CC=/usr/bin/cc ./configure (options - see below)<br></pre>
                
<p>By default, the Citadel system will install in <tt>/usr/local/citadel</tt>.
    If you wish to place it in a different directory, you can instead do:</p>
                  
<pre>./configure --prefix=/export/home/citadel      (or whatever)<br></pre>
                  
<p>If you've got Berkeley DB installed in a non-standard location, you can 
   help the configure script find it by doing something like this:</p>
                  
<pre>./configure --with-db=/usr/local/BerkeleyDB-4.1<br></pre>
                  
<p>The configure script prefers Berkeley DB if it is available, but will fall
back to GDBM if it has to.</p>
                  
<p>File permissions are always a bother to work with. You don't want Citadel 
   to crash because someone couldn't access a file, but you also don't  want 
   shell users peeking into the binaries to do things like reading others' 
  mail, finding private rooms, etc.  The Citadel server needs to be started
    as root in order to bind to privileged ports, but as soon as its initialization
   is finished, it changes its user ID to your BBS user ID in order to avoid
   security holes.</p>
                  
<h3><a name="Upgrading"></a></h3>
             
<h3>Upgrading</h3>
              
<p>Any existing Citadel installation which is at version 5.50 or newer may
   be upgraded in place without the need to discard your existing data files.</p>
              
<p>Upgrading to a new version uses the same build procedure as compiling
the program for a fresh install, except that you want to do <tt>make install-exec</tt> 
    instead of <tt>make install</tt>.  This will overwrite the programs but 
  not your data.  <b>Be sure to shut down citserver during this process!</b> 
   If Citadel is running while you upgrade, you may face data corruption issues.<br>
       </p>
              
<p>After doing <tt>make install-exec</tt>, you should run <tt>setup</tt>
again to bring your data files up to date.  Please see the setup section
below for more information on this.</p>
                
<h3><a name="The_citadel.rc_file"></a>The <tt>citadel.rc</tt> file</h3>
                  
<p>The text-based client included with Citadel is suitable for BBS applications. 
    Much of its command set and other behavior is configurable through a Run
   Control (RC) file. The standard client looks for this file in the following
   locations: </p>
             
<ul>
        <li><tt>$HOME/.citadelrc</tt></li>
        <li><tt>/usr/local/lib/citadel.rc</tt></li>
        <li><i>your-Citadel-directory</i><tt>/citadel.rc</tt></li>
               
</ul>
        The next couple of sections deal with client-side configuration.
           
<h3><a name="Using_an_external_editor_for_message"></a>Using an external editor
for message composition</h3>
                  
<p>Citadel/UX has a built-in message editor.  However, you can also use your 
   favorite text editor to write messages.  To do this you simply put a line 
   in your citadel.rc file like this:</p>
                  
<pre>editor=/usr/bin/vi<br></pre>
                
<p>The above example would make Citadel call the vi editor when using  the 
   <tt><b>.E</b>nter <b>E</b>ditor</tt> command. You can also make it the 
default   editor for the <tt><b>E</b>nter</tt> command by editing the <tt>citadel.rc</tt>
    file.  <b>But be warned:</b> external editors on public systems can be
 a  security hole, because they usually provide users with the ability to
drop  into a shell on the host system, or save files using names other than
the  name of the temporary file they are editing.  If you intend to use an
external  editor on a public BBS, make sure you use one that has been hardened
for such a purpose -- one which has had the 'shell' and 'save as' commands
disabled,   as well as any other functions which a destructive user could
use to gain   unauthorized access to your host system.</p>
                  
<h3><a name="Printing_messages"></a>Printing messages</h3>
                  
<p>Citadel/UX can send messages to a printer, or just about anywhere else 
   in your system.  The variable <tt>PRINTCMD</tt> in <tt>citadel.rc</tt> 
specifies   what command you use to print.  Text is sent to the standard input
(stdin)   of the print command.</p>
                  
<p>So if you did this:</p>
                  
<pre>printcmd="nl|pr|lpr -Plocal"<br></pre>
                  
<p>...that would add line numbers, then paginate, then print on the printer 
   named "local".  There's tons of stuff you can do with this feature.  For 
  example, you could use a command like <tt>cat &lt;&lt;$HOME/archive</tt> 
 to save copies of important messages in a textfile.  Again, this is probably 
   something you don't want to configure for a public BBS host -- most system 
   administrators don't want remote users sending arbitrary things to local 
  printers.</p>
                  
<h3><a name="URL_viewing"></a>URL viewing</h3>
                  
<p>This is one more feature which is appropriate for local users.  While reading
a message that has Internet URL's in it, you can select the <tt><b>U</b>RL-view</tt> 
   command, and it will perform some pre-defined action (usually, this is 
to   open up the URL in a web browser).  For example:</p>
                  
<pre>urlcmd=netscape -remote "openURL(%s)"<br></pre>
                  
<p>In the above example, it would open up the URL in an open <a
 href="http://www.netscape.com/download">Netscape</a> window.</p>
                  
<h3><a name="Setup_and_login"></a></h3>
             
<h3>Setup and login</h3>
                  
<p>Before logging in for the first time, you must run the setup program. 
To begin this procedure, enter the following commands:</p>
                  
<pre>cd /usr/local/citadel<br>./setup<br></pre>
                  
<p>The setup program will guide you through a simple configuration procedure. 
   It will ask you what directory to place your data files in -- the default 
   is the current directory, which is usually the sensible thing to select. 
   If you want to run more than one instance of Citadel on the same host, 
however,   you can specify a different directory here -- just remember to 
specify the   directory name again when you start up the server later on.</p>
                  
<p><tt>setup</tt> will then shut down the Citadel service if it is found to
be running.</p>
                  
<p>You will then be prompted for the name of the system administrator. This 
   is not merely a cosmetic option -- when you log in to your system a little 
   while from now, you'll log in with this name, and it will automatically 
 assign  your account the highest access level.</p>
                  
<p>Next, you will be prompted for the User ID of the Citadel account on your 
   host system.  If you have an account called <tt>bbs</tt>, <tt>guest</tt>,
    or <tt>citadel</tt>, that account's UID will be the default.  If you
are    upgrading or reconfiguring an existing system, the existing value
will be   preserved.</p>
                  
<p>Then you will be prompted for a server port number.  This is the TCP port 
   which Citadel clients use to connect to your Citadel server.  In almost 
 all  cases, you want to use the default -- port 504, which is the official 
 port  number assigned by the IANA for Citadel implementations.</p>
                  
<p>The Citadel service will then be started, and you will see the following 
   message:</p>
                  
<pre>Setup is finished.  You may now log in.<br></pre>
                  
<p>Setup is now complete, on most systems, anyway.  Please see below to find 
   out if you need to do anything else:</p>
                  
<h3><a name="Configuring_your_host_system_to_start"></a>Configuring your host
system to start the service</h3>
                  
<p><b>Please note:</b> this topic involves modifications made to <tt>/etc/services</tt> 
   and <tt>/etc/inittab</tt> in order to configure your host system to automatically 
   start the Citadel service.  <tt>setup</tt> will automatically perform these
   steps if it can, and if you allow it to -- just answer 'Yes' when prompted,
   and everything will be taken care of for you.  If you answer 'No' -- or
 if  your system is a little bit odd (for example, BSD systems don't have
<tt>/etc/inittab</tt>)  -- read this section and do what you need to in order
to get things configured.</p>
                   
<p>Before you can use Citadel, you must define the "citadel" service to your 
    system.  This is accomplished by adding a line to your /etc/services file
   that looks something like this:</p>
                  
<pre>citadel		504/tcp			# Citadel/UX Server<br></pre>
                  
<p>504 is the port number officially designated by the IANA for use by Citadel. 
    There should not be any need to use a different port number, unless you 
  are  running multiple Citadels on the same computer and therefore need a
 different port for each one.</p>
                  
<p>The next step is to arrange for the server to start.  The <tt>citserver</tt> 
    program is the main Citadel server.  Before we cover the recommended method
   of starting the server, let's examine its usage options:</p>
                  
<pre>citserver [-hHomeDir] [-xDebugLevel] [-tTraceFile] [-d] [-f]<br></pre>
                  
<p>The options are as follows:</p>
                  
<p><tt>-hHomeDir</tt> - the directory your BBS data files live in.  This should,
of course, be a directory that you've run the <tt>setup</tt> program against
to set up some data files.  If a directory is not specified, the directory
name which was specified in the <tt>Makefile</tt> will be used.</p>
                  
<p><tt>-xDebugLevel</tt> - Set the verbosity of trace messages printed.  The
available  debugging levels are: </p>
               
<ul>
         <li>1 - Internal errors (failed thread creation, malloc problems,
 etc.)     </li>
          <li>2 - Network errors (broken sockets, failed socket creation) 
       </li>
          <li>3 - Begin and end of sessions, startup/shutdown of server </li>
          <li>5 - Server commands being sent from clients </li>
          <li>7 - Entry and exit of various functions  </li>
          <li>8 - Entry and exit of critical sections </li>
          <li>9 - Various debugging checkpoints (insanely verbose) </li>
               
</ul>
                  
<p><tt>-tTraceFile</tt> - Tell the server where to send its debug/trace output. 
     Normally it is sent to stdout.</p>
                  
<p><tt>-d</tt> - Run as a daemon; i.e. in the background.  This switch would 
   be necessary if you were  starting the Citadel server, for example, from 
  an rc.local script (which is  not recommended, because this won't allow 
the  server to automatically restart when it is shut down).</p>
                  
<p><tt>-f</tt> - Defragment all the databases upon startup.  This isn't normally 
   necessary due to the nature of the data stored in Citadel, but the option 
   is provided in case you need it.  (Note that this only applies to GDBM 
installations;   if you are using Berkeley DB it has no effect.)</p>
                  
<p>The preferred method of starting the Citadel server is to place an entry 
   in your /etc/inittab file.  This will conveniently bring the server up 
when   your  system is up, and terminate it gracefully when your system is 
shutting   down.   The exact syntax for your system may vary, but here's an
entry that   could be used on a Linux system:</p>
                  
<pre>cit:2345:respawn:/usr/local/citadel/citserver -h/usr/local/citadel -t/dev/tty9 -x3<br></pre>
                  
<p>In this example, we've chosen debugging level 3, and have the trace stuff 
   output to one of the virtual consoles.  It's important to remember to turn
   off any getty that is set up on that virtual console, if you do this. 
After   making this change, the command <tt>init q</tt> works on most systems 
to  tell init to re-read the file.  If in doubt, just reboot the computer.</p>
                  
<h3><a name="Logging_in_for_the_first_time"></a>Logging in for the first time</h3>
                  
<p>At this point, your system is ready to run. Run the <tt>citadel</tt> program 
   from the shell and log in as a new user.  NOTE: the first user account 
to   be created will automatically be set to access level 6 (Aide).  This 
overcomes   some obvious logistical problems - normally, Aide access is given 
by another   Aide, but since there aren't any on your system yet, this isn't 
possible.</p>
                  
<h3><a name="Welcoming_new_users"></a>Welcoming new users</h3>
                  
<p>Sometimes you might decide that you want a welcome message (or several 
   different messages) automatically mailed to new users upon their first 
login.   Now there is a way to do this.  If you create a room called <tt>New 
User  Greetings</tt>, and it is a <i>private</i> room (invitation-only probably 
   makes the most sense), any messages you enter into that room will automatically 
   be delivered to all new users upon registration.</p>
                  
<p>You can put anything you want there: a welcome message, system policies, 
   special information, etc.  You can also put as many messages there as you
   want to (although it really doesn't make sense to clutter new users' mailboxes
   with lots of junk).</p>
                  
<p>Don't worry about wasting disk space, either.  Citadel has a single-instance 
    message store, so all the new users are actually looking at the same copy
   of the message on disk.</p>
                    
<h3><a name="Space_for_adding_your_own_client"></a>Space for adding your own
client features (doors)</h3>
                  
<p><b>Please take note!</b>  This function really represents the "old" way 
   of doing things, and it doesn't fit in well with the client/server  paradigm. 
    Please consider it "deprecated" because it may be removed someday.</p>
                  
<p>The "doorway" feature is just a generic way to add features to the system. 
   I called it "Doorway" to make it resemble the doors on non-Unix boards, 
 but  as we all know, us Unix types don't have to write special code to access 
  the modem. :-)  Anyway, when a user hits the <tt><b>*</b></tt> (doorway) 
 command, Citadel does...</p>
                  
<pre>USERNAME=(username); export USERNAME<br>./subsystem (user-number) (screen-width) (access level)<br></pre>
                  
<p>...so you can put whatever you want in there.  I suggest putting in a menu
program to allow the users to pick one of a number of programs, etc.  Do
be aware that door programs will only be available when the client and server
programs are running on the <i>same</i> computer, and when the user is running
the text-mode client.  Because of these restrictions, Door programs are being
utilized less and less every day.</p>
                  
<h3><a name="Troubleshooting_and_getting_help"></a>Troubleshooting and getting 
   help</h3>
                  
<p>That's just about all the information you need to install the system. 
But if you get stuck, you can visit UNCENSORED! BBS and report a problem or
ask for help.  But if you intend to report a problem getting the Citadel server
to run, <i>please</i> double-check the following things first:  </p>
               
<ul>
         <li>Did you do <tt>./configure &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; make install</tt>
     ?? </li>
          <li>Did you run setup? </li>
          <li>Did you start the server? </li>
               
</ul>
                  
<p>To report a problem, you can log on to UNCENSORED! or any other BBS on 
   the Citadel network which carries the <tt>Citadel/UX&gt;</tt> room.  Please 
   DO NOT e-mail the developers directly.  Post a request for help on the 
BBS,   with all of the following information: </p>
               
<ul>
         <li>The exact nature of your difficulty </li>
          <li>A transcript of the error message(s) if possible </li>
          <li>The version of Citadel you are running </li>
          <li>The version of Berkeley DB present on your system </li>
          <li>Which operating system you are running, and what version </li>
          <li>If you are running a Linux system, we need to know which distribution,
    and the version of the kernel, libc, and pthreads you are using (it would
    help to post the output of a <tt>ldd ./citserver</tt> command). </li>

<p>Citadel/UX, when installed properly, will do most of its maintenance by
    itself.  It is intended to be run unattended for extended periods of
time,    and most installations do just that without any software failures.</p>
                
<p>The system has seven access levels.  Most users are at the bottom and have
no special privileges. Aides are selected people who have special access within
the Citadel program.  Room Aides only have this access in a certain room.
 Preferred users can be selected by Aides for access to preferred only rooms.
 A sysop is anyone who has access to the various sysop utilities - these
are in their own executable files, which should have their permissions set
to allow only sysops to run them.  You should either create a sysops group
in /etc/group, or use some other existing group for this purpose.</p>
                   
<p>Aides have access to EVERY room on the system, public and private (all
    types). They also have access to commands starting with <tt>.<b>A</b>ide</tt> 
   in addition to being able to delete and move messages.  The system room,
   <tt>Aide&gt;</tt>, is accessible only by those users designated as Aides.</p>

<h3><a name="Editing_rooms"></a>Editing rooms</h3>
                  
<p>This command allows any aide to change the parameters of a room.  Go to
    the room you wish to edit and enter the <tt><b>.A</b>ide <b>E</b>dit
room</tt>    command.  A series of prompts will be displayed.  The existing
parameters    will be displayed in brackets; simply press return if you want
to leave  any  or all of them unchanged.</p>
                
<pre> <br>Room name [IG's Fun Room]:<br></pre>
                 
<p>...the name of the room.</p>
                
<pre>Private room [Yes]? <br></pre>
                 
<p>...enter Yes if you wish to restrict access to the room, or no if the room
is to be accessible by all users.  Note that Citadel doesn't bother users
about access to rooms every time they need to access the room.  Once a user
gains access to a private room, it then behaves like a public room to them.
The following four questions will only be asked if you selected Private...</p>
                
<pre>Accessible by guessing room name [No]?<br></pre>
                 
<p>...if you enter Yes, the room will not show up in users' <tt><b>K</b>nown 
   rooms</tt> listing, but if they <tt><b>.G</b>oto</tt> the room (typing 
the   room's full name), they will gain access to the room.</p>
                
<pre>Accessible by entering a password [No]?<br>Room password [mypasswd]:  <br></pre>
                 
<p>...this adds an additional layer of security to the room, prompting users
    for a password before they can gain access to the room.</p>
                 
<p>If you did not select guessname or passworded, then the only way users 
   can access the room is if an Aide explicitly invites them to the room using
   the <tt><b>.A</b>ide <b>R</b>oom <b>I</b>nvite user</tt> command.</p>
                
<pre>Cause current users to forget room [No] ? No<br></pre>
                 
<p>Enter Yes if you wish to kick out anyone who currently has access to the 
   room.</p>
                
<pre>Preferred users only [No]? No<br></pre>
                 
<p>Enter Yes if you wish to restrict the room to only users who have level 
   5 (Preferred User) status (and Aides too, of course).  You should make 
the   room public if you intend to do this, otherwise the two restrictions 
will   be COMBINED.</p>
                 
<pre>Read-only room [No]? No<br></pre>
                 
<p>If you set a room to Read-Only, then normal users will not be allowed to
post messages in it.  Messages may only be posted by Aides, and by utility
    programs such as the networker and the "aidepost" utility.  This is useful
    in situations where a room is used exclusively for important announcements,
    or if you've set up a room to receive an Internet mailing list and posting
    wouldn't make sense.  Other uses will, of course, become apparent as
the    need arises.</p>
                
<p>Now for a few other attributes...</p>
                
<pre>Directory room [Yes]? Yes<br></pre>
                 
<p>...enter Yes if you wish to associate a directory with this room.  This 
   can be used as a small file repository for files relevant to the topic 
of   the room. If you enter Yes, you will also be prompted with the following 
  four questions:</p>
                
<pre>Directory name [mydirname]: <br></pre>
                 
<p>...the name of the subdirectory to put this room's files in.  The name 
   of the directory created will be <tt><i>&lt;your BBS directory&gt;</i>/files/<i>&lt;room 
   dir name&gt;</i></tt>.</p>
                    
<pre>Uploading allowed [Yes]? Yes<br></pre>
                 
<p>...enter Yes if users are allowed to upload to this room.</p>
                
<pre>Downloading allowed [Yes]? Yes<br></pre>
                  
<p>...enter Yes if users are allowed to download from this room.</p>
                
<pre>Visible directory [Yes]? Yes<br></pre>
                  
<p>...enter Yes if users can read the directory of this room.</p>
                
<pre>Network shared room [No]? No<br></pre>
                  
<p>...you can share a room over a network without setting this flag, and
vice versa, but what this flag does is twofold: </p>
             
<ul>
        <li>It prevents people with no network access from entering messages
  here     </li>
         <li>Messages are displayed with the name of their originating system 
  in  the header. </li>
             
</ul>
                 
<pre>Permanent room [No]? No<br></pre>
                 
<p>Citadel contains an 'auto purger' which is capable of removing rooms which
    have not been posted in for a pre-defined period of time (by default
this    is set to two weeks).  If you wish to keep this from happening to
a particular     room, you can set this option.  (Keep in mind that <tt>Lobby&gt;</tt>,
 <tt>Aide&gt;</tt>,   any private mailbox rooms, any network shared rooms,
 and any rooms with a  file directory are automatically permanent.)</p>
                
<pre>Anonymous messages [No]? No<br>Ask users whether to make messages anonymous [No]? No<br></pre>
                  
<p>...you can have rooms in which all messages are automatically anonymous,
    and you can have rooms in which users are prompted whether to make a
message     anonymous when they enter it.  The real identity of the author
of each  message  is still revealed to the Room Aide for this room, as well
as any  system-wide  Aides.</p>
                
<pre>Room aide [Joe Responsible]: <br></pre>
                 
<p>...on larger systems, it helps to designate a person to be responsible 
   for a room.  Room Aides have access to a restricted set of Aide commands, 
   ONLY when they are in the room in which they have this privilege.  They 
 can  edit the room, delete the room, delete and move messages, and invite 
 or kick  out users (if it is a private room), but they cannot perform aide 
 commands  that are not room-related (such as changing users access levels).</p>
                
<pre>Listing order [64]: <br></pre>
                
<p>This is just a simple way to try to control the order rooms are listed 
   in when users call up a <tt><b>K</b>nown Rooms</tt> listing.  Rooms with 
  a lower listing order are displayed prior to rooms with a higher listing 
 order.  It has no other effect.  For users who list rooms in floor order, 
 the display will sort first by floor, then by listing order.</p>
                
<pre>Message expire policy (? for list) [0]:<br></pre>
                
<p>This provides you with the opportunity to select how long each message 
   will remain in a room before automatically being deleted.  Press <tt><b>?</b></tt>
    for a list of options.  You can choose to keep messages around forever
 (or   until they are manually deleted), until they become a certain number
 of days  old, or until a certain number of additional messages are posted
 in the room,  at which time the oldest ones will scroll out.</p>
                
<p>You will notice that you can also fall back to the default expire policy 
   for the floor upon which the room resides.  This is the default setting. 
   You can change the floor's default with the <tt><b>;A</b>ide <b>E</b>dit 
  floor</tt> command.  The default setting for the floor default, in turn, 
 is the system default setting, which can be changed using the <tt><b>.A</b>ide 
  <b>S</b>ystem configuration <b>G</b>eneral</tt> command.</p>
                
<pre>Save changes (y/n)? Yes<br></pre>
                
<p>...this gives you an opportunity to back out, if you feel you really messed 
   things up while editing.</p>
                
<h3><a name="File_directories"></a>File directories</h3>
                 
<p>If you have created any directory rooms, you can attach file descriptions 
   to the filenames through a special file called <tt>filedir</tt>. Each line
   contains the name of a file in the directory, followed by a space and
then    a description of the file, such as:</p>
                 
<pre>myfile.txt This is a description of my file.<br>phluff A phile phull of phluff!<br></pre>
                 
<p>...this would create file descriptions for the files <tt>myfile.txt</tt>
    and <tt>phluff</tt> which would be displayed along with the directory.
  It should also be noted that when users upload files to your system, they
  will be prompted for file descriptions, which will be added to the <tt>filedir</tt> 
   file.  If one does not exist, it will be created.</p>
                
<h3><a name="Creating_and_editing_user_accounts"></a>Creating and editing 
   user accounts</h3>
                
<p>Anyone with Aide level access may use the <tt><b>.A</b>ide edit <b>U</b>ser</tt>
    command to create and/or edit user accounts.  There are several parameters 
   which can be set here.</p>
                
<p>To create a user:</p>
                
<pre>Lobby&gt; . Aide edit User <br>User name: New User Name<br>No such user.<br>Do you want to create this user? Yes<br></pre>
                
<p>At this point, the new user account has been created, and the command will
continue as if you were editing an existing account.  Therefore the remainder
of this procedure is the same for creating and editing:</p>
                
<pre>Lobby&gt; . Aide edit User <br>User name: person of significance<br>User #70 - Person of Significance  PW: <br> <br><br>,  <br> <br> <br><br>Current access level: 4 (Network User)<br></pre>
                
<p>The blank lines are the user's 'registration' information -- personal
information such as full name, address, telephone number, etc.  This information
will comprise the user's vCard in both their user profile and in the Global
Address Book.</p>
                
<pre>Change password [No]: No<br></pre>
                
<p>...answer Yes to set or change the password for this account.</p>
                
<pre>Access level [4]: <br></pre>
                
<p>...this allows you to set or change the access level for this account. 
    The access levels available are as follows: </p>
             
<ul>
        <li>0 - Deleted.  (This immediately deletes the account.) </li>
         <li>1 - New, unvalidated user </li>
         <li>2 - Problem user (severely restricts account - use for probationary 
   access) </li>
         <li>3 - User with no network privileges.  Same access as a normal
 user   except cannot post messages in rooms shared on a network. </li>
         <li>4 - Normal user </li>
         <li>5 - Preferred user (access is granted to privileged rooms) </li>
         <li>6 - Aide (administrative access to the whole system) </li>
             
</ul>
                   
<pre>Permission to send/receive Internet mail [ No]? No<br></pre>
                
<p>If your system is configured to only allow Internet mail privileges to
    certain users, this is where you can grant or revoke that privilege.</p>
                
<pre>Ask user to register again [Yes]: Yes<br></pre>
                
<p>If you answer Yes to this question, the user will be presented with a
'registration' screen or set of prompts, the next time they log in using
a Citadel client.  This will prompt them for their full name, address, telephone
number, etc.</p>
                
<pre>Times called [0]: <br>Messages posted [0]: <br></pre>
                
<p>These statistics are available for informational purposes only, so there
    is normally no need to change them.</p>
                
<pre>Set last call to now [No]: No<br>Purge time (in days, 0 for system default [0]: <br></pre>
                
<p>Citadel contains an auto-purger which is capable of automatically deleting
    accounts which have not been accessed in a predefined period of time.
 If   you choose to perform this operation, you can 'touch' the account of
 a wayward   user by setting their 'last call' time to 'now'.  You can also
 adjust, on  a per-user basis, the amount of time which must pass before
their  account  is purged by the system.  This time is set in days.  You
can also  specify  0 days to indicate that you wish to use the system default
setting.</p>
                 
<h3><a name="Deleting_and_moving_messages"></a>Deleting and moving messages</h3>
                
<p>Aides and Room Aides have the ability to delete and move messages.  After
    each message, the normal prompt appears:</p>
                
<pre>(8) &lt;B&gt;ack &lt;A&gt;gain &lt;Q&gt;uote &lt;R&gt;eply &lt;N&gt;ext &lt;S&gt;top m&lt;Y&gt; next &lt;?&gt;help -&gt;<br></pre>
                   
<p>Entering <tt><b>D</b>elete</tt> will delete the message. A <tt>(y/n)</tt> 
   prompt will appear to confirm that you really want to delete the message.
    Entering <tt><b>M</b>ove</tt> will prompt for a room to which the message
    should be moved.</p>
                
<h3><a name="Customizing_the_help_files"></a>Customizing the help files</h3>
                     
<p>The subdirectory called <tt>help</tt> contains your system's help files.
    There's nothing hard-coded into the system that dictates what files should 
   be there. Whenever a user types the command <tt><b>.H</b>elp</tt> followed 
   by the name of a help file, it displays the contents of that help file.</p>
                 
<p>The help files that come with the system, of course, are enough to guide
    a user through its operation.  But you can add, change, or remove help
 files   to suit whatever is appropriate for your system.</p>
                 
<p>There are several strings that you can put in help files that will be automatically
substituted with other strings.  They are:</p>
                
<pre> <br> ^nodename    = The node name of your system on a Citadel/UX network<br> ^humannode   = Human-readable node name (also your node name on C86Net)<br> ^fqdn        = Your system's fully-qualified domain name<br> ^username    = The name of the user reading the help file<br> ^usernum     = The user number of the user reading the help file<br> ^sysadm      = The name of the system administraor (i.e., you)<br> ^variantname = The name of the BBS software you're running<br> ^bbsdir      = The directory on the host system in which you have<br>                installed the Citadel system.<br></pre>
                 
<p>So, for example, you could create a help file which looked like:</p>
                 
<pre>  "Lots of help, of course, is available right here on ^humannode.  Of<br>course, if you still have trouble, you could always bug ^sysadm about it!"<br></pre>
                        
<h3><a name="Site_configuration"></a>Site configuration</h3>
                
<p>Once your Citadel server is up and running, the first thing you'll want 
   to do is customize and tune it.  This can be done from the text-based client
   with the <tt><b>.A</b>ide <b>S</b>ystem configuration <b>G</b>eneral</tt>
    command, or from WebCit (if you have it installed) by clicking 'Advanced 
   Options' followed by 'Edit site-wide configuration.'   Either method will 
   offer the same configuration options.  This document shows the text mode 
  client being used.</p>
                
<p>The first set of options deal with the identification of your system.</p>
                  
<pre>Lobby&gt; . Aide System configuration General<br>Node name [uncnsrd]: <br>Fully qualified domain name [uncensored.citadel.org]: <br>Human readable node name [Uncensored]: <br>Modem dialup number [US 914 999 9999]: <br>Geographic location of this system [Mount Kisco, NY]: <br>Name of system administrator [IGnatius T Foobar]: <br>Paginator prompt [<jinkies
 !="" more="" text="" on="" the="" next="" screen="">]: <br></jinkies></pre>
                
<p>'Node name' refers to the short, unqualified node name by which your system 
   is known on a Citadel network.  Generally it will be the same as the unqualified 
   host name of your computer; this is, in fact, the default setting.</p>
                
<p>Then enter the fully-qualified domain name (FQDN) of your system.  If you
are not on the Internet, you can simply set it to the same as your unqualified 
   host name.  Otherwise you should set this value to the host name by which 
   your system is most commonly known.</p>
                
<p>The field called 'Human-readable node name' (also known as the 'node title' 
   or 'organization name' in other software) is used solely for display purposes. 
    Set it to the actual name of your system as you want it to appear in banners,
   messages, etc.</p>
                
<p>If you have a modem or bank of modems answering data calls for your system, 
   enter it in the field marked 'Modem dialup number.'  Otherwise you may 
leave   it blank.</p>
                
<p>'Geographic location of this system' is another display field.  Enter a
 city and state, or city and country. </p>
                
<p>'Name of system administrator' is important!  Any user who logs on with 
    the name you enter here will automatically be granted Aide privileges. 
 This  is one of two ways for the system administrator to grant himself/herself 
  Aide access to the system when initially setting it up.  (The other is simply
  to have the first account created on a new installation.)</p>
                   
<p>The next set of options are your system's security settings.  Before delving 
   into the actual options, we should review the various access levels available 
   on the system.  Citadel has seven access levels:</p>
                
<ul>
        <li>0 (Deleted).  A user whose access level is set to 0 will automatically 
   be deleted by the system.  </li>
         <li>1 (New User).   Users at this level may only read messages.
 Entering    messages is prohibited, except in the <tt>Mail&gt;</tt> room, 
where a message    to 'sysop' may be entered.  </li>
         <li>2 (Problem User).  Also known as 'Twit.'  </li>
         <li>3 (Local User).  May enter messages, except in rooms shared
on  a    Citadel network.  </li>

of  the   system.  (This access level may also be granted to a user only for
a specific  room, please see 'Room Aide' for more information.)  </li>

<p>'Registration' refers to the process of a user entering various personal
    contact information (real name, address, telephone number, etc.) into
the    system.  When enabled, this information is stored as a vCard object
on the  system in two places: the user's <tt>My Citadel Config&gt;</tt> room,
 and  in the <tt>Global Address Book&gt;</tt> room.  (Note: the latter should 
  be  made private on publicly-accessible systems, for obvious reasons.)</p>
                
<p>If you answer Yes to 'Require registration for new users' then each new
    user, upon creating a new account, will immediately be entered into the
  registration process.  On the other hand, if you answer Yes to 'Disable
self-service  user account creation' then new users will not be able to log
in at all --  all accounts must be created by an Aide.</p>
                
<p>'Initial access level for new users' should be set to 1 (New User) if you
  would like to review each new user's registration info before granting
    them higher access.  This would be done periodically with the <tt><b>.A</b>ide 
   <b>V</b>alidate new users</tt> command.   If you do not require registration, 
   you should set the initial access level to 4 (Network User).</p>
                
<p>Given the above options, it then becomes clear that there are generally
    two ways you can set up your Citadel system, depending on its purpose:</p>
                
<ul>
        <li><b>A public access BBS or message board</b> - since you do not
 know   who might want to log in, self-service account creation needs to
stay  enabled.    If you want to be strict about users identifying themselves,
then you should    also require users to register (just remember to post
a privacy policy if   you're going to collect personal information) -- then
set the initial access  level to 1 (New User), so new users cannot post messages
until after you've  validated them.  For a more lax environment, you can
remove the registration   requirement and grant new accounts level 4 (Normal
User) access on the first   visit. </li>
         <li><b>A private email/groupware system for your organization</b>
 -  in  this case, disable self-service account creation; you don't want
strangers    welcoming themselves to your system.  You'll probably also want
to disable    registration, because you or some other site administrator
will be entering    users' contact info when you create their accounts. 
Since this is also  how  you assign their Internet e-mail addresses, it's
probably a good idea  to do it yourself instead of expecting them to do it.
  </li>
             
</ul>
                
<p>'Access level required to create rooms' is up to you.  You might wish to
restrict the creation of new rooms only to Aides, or you might wish to  allow
anyone to create a room.  The latter is one of the Citadel culture's most
long-standing traditions; the former may be appropriate if users are abusing
this privilege.</p>
                
<p>You have the ability to 'Automatically give room aide privs to a user who
  creates a private room.'  If you answer Yes, then any user who creates a
guess-name, passworded, or invitation-only room will automatically become
    the room aide, and will have access to a subset of the <tt><b>.A</b>ide</tt>
    command set while in that room.  If you would rather grant this permission 
     manually, answer No.</p>
                
<p>Another tradition in the Citadel culture is to refrain from deleting 
problem users, but instead to 'twit' them (reduce their access level to 2
[Problem User]).   You can then 'Automatically move problem user messages
to twit room' (answer Yes, then specify 'Name of twit room' and remember
to create that room).  If you employ this logic, any user with level 2 (Problem
User) access will continue to have access to the same set of rooms, but all
messages posted will automatically be routed to the Trashcan (or whatever
you call your twit room).</p>
                
<p>If you have Internet mail configured, you have the option of restricting 
   its use on a user-by-user basis.  If you wish to do this, answer Yes to 
 'Restrict  Internet mail to only those with that privilege.' Obviously this 
 makes no  sense for an internal e-mail system, but for a public BBS it might 
 be appropriate.</p>
                
<p>Normally, Aides have access to every room, public or private, except for 
   user mailboxes.  They are also forbidden from <tt><b>Z</b>ap</tt>ping rooms,
   because the review of content is considered one of their roles.  If you
 wish  to change these policies, the next two options allow you to.  You
may  'Allow  Aides to Zap (forget) rooms', in which case they may use the
<tt><b>Z</b>ap</tt>    command just like any other user.  Furthermore, if
you 'Allow system Aides    access to user mailboxes', then they may <tt><b>.G</b>oto</tt> 
any private    mailbox belonging to any user, using a special room name format.</p>
                
<p>If your local security and/or privacy policy dictates that you keep a
log of all pages (instant messages) that go through the system, then answer
Yes to 'Log all pages'.  If you answer Yes, you will be prompted for the
name of a room to which all pages will be logged.  If you answer No, then
only the sender and recipient of each individual message will receive a copy.</p>
                
<p>The next set of options deals with the tuning of your system.  It is usually 
   safe to leave these untouched.</p>
                
<pre>Server connection idle timeout (in seconds) [900]: <br>Maximum concurrent sessions [20]: <br>Maximum message length [2147483647]: <br>Minimum number of worker threads [5]: <br>Maximum number of worker threads [256]: <br></pre>
                
<p>The 'Server connection idle timeout' is for the connection between client
    and server software.  It is <b>not</b> an idle timer for the user interface.
    900 seconds (15 minutes) is the default and a sane setting.</p>
                
<p>'Maximum concurrent sessions' is the highest number of user sessions you
    wish to allow on your system at any given time.  Citadel can scale to
hundreds   of concurrent users, but if you have limited hardware or (more
likely) limited   bandwidth, you might wish to set a maximum.  You can also
set it to zero  for no limit.</p>
                
<p>'Maximum message length' is just that.  This could be a good way to prevent 
   enormous multimedia files from finding their way into your message base. 
   This maximum is enforced in all protocols and is also advertised by the 
 ESMTP service.</p>
                
<p>The minimum and maximum number of worker threads can be tuned to your
liking.  Citadel will attempt to keep one worker thread running per session,
within these constraints.  You should be aware that due to the use of the
worker thread model, Citadel can handle a large number of concurrent sessions
with a much smaller thread pool.  If you don't know the programming theory
behind multithreaded servers, you should leave these parameters alone.</p>
                
<p>The next set of options affect how Citadel behaves on a network.</p>
                
<pre>How often to run network jobs (in seconds) [3600]: <br>SMTP server port (-1 to disable) [25]: <br>POP3 server port (-1 to disable) [110]:<br>IMAP server port (-1 to disable) [143]:<br></pre>
                
<p>'How often to run network jobs' refers to the sharing of content on a
Citadel network.  If your system is on a Citadel network, this configuration
item dictates how often the Citadel server will contact other Citadel servers 
   to send and receive messages.  In reality, this will happen more frequently 
   than you specify, because other Citadel servers will be contacting yours 
  at regular intervals as well.</p>
                
<p>Then you can specify TCP port numbers for the SMTP, POP3, and IMAP services. 
    For a system being used primarily for Internet e-mail, these are essential, 
   so you'll want to specify the standard port numbers: 25, 110, and 143. 
 If  Citadel is running alongside some other mail system, though, then you 
 might  want to choose other, unused port numbers, or enter -1 for any protocol 
 to  disable it entirely.</p>
                
<p>The final set of options configures system-wide defaults for the auto-purger:</p>
                
<pre>Default user purge time (days) [120]: <br>Default room purge time (days) [30]: <br>System default message expire policy (? for list) [2]: <br>Keep how many messages online? [150]:<br></pre>
                
<p>Any user who does not log in for the period specified in 'Default user
    purge time' will be deleted the next time a purge is run.  This setting
  may be modified on a per-user basis.</p>
                
<p>'Default room purge time' behaves the same way, and may also be modified
    on a per-room basis.</p>
                
<p>'System default message expire policy' defines the way in which old messages 
   are expired (purged) off the system.  You can specify any of:</p>
                
<ul>
        <li>Purge by age (specify in days)  </li>
         <li>Purge by message count in the room (specify number of messages)
     </li>
         <li>Do not purge at all </li>
             
</ul>
                
<p>Again, this setting may be overridden on a per-floor basis, and the floor 
   setting may be overridden on a per-room basis.</p>
                  
<pre>Save this configuration? No<br></pre>
                
<p>When you're done, enter 'Yes' to confirm the changes, or 'No' to discard
    the changes.</p>

<h2 align="center"><a name="Configuring_Citadel_for_Internet_e-mail"></a>Configuring 
  Citadel for Internet e-mail</h2>
         
<div align="justify">     
<h3><a name="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h3>
     As you know by now, Citadel is a completely self-contained, full-featured 
  Internet e-mail system. &nbsp;When you run Citadel you do not need any other
  mail software on your host system. &nbsp;This eliminates the need for tedious
  mucking about with sendmail, qmail, postfix, Cyrus, the UW IMAP server,
or  any of countless other needlessly complex programs that lead some people
 to the false assumption that Unix systems are difficult to administer.<br>
     <br>
     Some of the many features supported by Citadel are:<br>
         
<ul>
       <li>Built-in SMTP and ESMTP service, for delivering and receiving
e-mail   on the Internet</li>
       <li>Built-in POP3 service, for remote fetching of messages</li>
       <li>Built-in IMAP service, for access to mail using any standard mail
  client program</li>
       <li>Web mail (implemented using the "WebCit" middleware, which is
installed   separately)</li>
       <li>Support for mailing lists, in both "individual message" and "digest" 
  formats</li>
       <li>Multiple/virtual domain support</li>
       <li>Any user may have multiple Internet e-mail addresses, in multiple
  domains</li>
       <li>Global address book (Users with addresses in a domain may be spread 
  out across many servers on a Citadel network)</li>
       <li>Easy-to-configure integration with <a
 href="http://www.spamassassin.org/">SpamAssassin</a> can block spam <i>before</i> 
  it enters the mail system</li>
         
</ul>
     This section of the documentation will demonstrate how to configure
these   features.<br>
     <br>
         
<h3><a name="Basic_site_configuration"></a>Basic site configuration</h3>
          
<p>Basic configuration of your Citadel system for Internet e-mail begins with
the <tt><b>.A</b>ide <b>S</b>ystem configuration <b>I</b>nternet</tt> command:</p>
          
<pre>Lobby&gt; <b>.A</b>ide <b>S</b>ystem configuration <b>I</b>nternet<br><br>###                    Host or domain                     Record type<br>--- -------------------------------------------------- --------------------<br>  1<br>&lt;A&gt;dd &lt;D&gt;elete &lt;S&gt;ave &lt;Q&gt;uit  -&gt;<br></pre>
          
<p>This is a "clean" setup.  For a simple, standalone e-mail system you simply
  have to enter the <tt><b>A</b>dd</tt> command:</p>
          
<pre>&lt;A&gt;dd &lt;D&gt;elete &lt;S&gt;ave &lt;Q&gt;uit  -&gt; <b>A</b>dd<br><br>Enter host name: schmeep.splorph.com<br> (1) localhost       (Alias for this computer)<br> (2) gateway domain  (Domain for all Citadel systems)<br> (3) smart-host      (Forward all outbound mail to this host)<br> (4) directory       (Consult the Global Address Book)<br> (5) SpamAssassin    (Address of SpamAssassin server)<br><br>Which one [1]:<br></pre>
          
<p><b>localhost:</b> Basically what you're doing here is telling Citadel
what any aliases for your machine are. If your machine were <tt>schmeep.splorph.com</tt>
  and you also had a DNS entry set up for <tt>blah.com</tt>, you might want
  to enter '1' and enter <tt>blah.com</tt> as your alias, so that e-mail
sent   to that address won't bounce.</p>
          
<p><i>Important tip:</i> if your system is known by one name and <i>only</i> 
  one domain, you might not even need to do this at all.  You will recall 
that  you entered your system's fully qualified domain name earlier when you
went  through the <tt><b>.A</b>ide <b>S</b>ystem configuration <b>G</b>eneral</tt> 
  command.  The domain name you entered there is automatically considered 
by  Citadel to be a 'localhost' entry in your Internet mail configuration. 
 It  does not hurt to enter it in both locations, though.</p>
          
<p><b>gateway domain:</b> this is a simple way of mapping various Citadel 
  hosts in an Internet domain.  For example, if you enter <tt>bar.com</tt> 
 as a gateway domain, then mail to users at <tt>foo.bar.com</tt> will be forwarded
 to the host called <tt>foo</tt> on a Citadel network, mail to users at <tt>kunst.bar.com</tt>
 will be delivered to the Citadel server called <tt>kunst</tt>, etc.  This
 feature has limited usefulness; if you are operating a network of Citadel
 servers, it is more likely that you will use the 'directory' feature, explained
 below.</p>
          
<p><b>smart-host:</b> Normally, Citadel sends outbound Internet e-mail directly
  to its destination.  This may not be appropriate for some sites; you may
 require (due to local convention, security policy, or whatever) that all
outbound  mail be sent to an SMTP relay or forwarder.  To configure this
functionality,  simply enter the domain name or IP address of your relay
as a 'smart-host'  entry.</p>
          
<p><b>directory:</b> a domain for which you are participating in directory 
  services across any number of Citadel nodes.  For example, if users who 
have  addresses in the domain <tt>citadel.org</tt> are spread out across multiple
 Citadel servers on your network, then enter <tt>citadel.org</tt> as a 'directory'
entry.  <i>For this to work, all Citadel servers participating in directory
service <b>must</b> carry and share the <tt>Global Address Book&gt;</tt>
  room.</i></p>
          
<p><b>spamassassin:</b> if you are running a <a
 href="http://www.spamassassin.org">SpamAssassin</a> service anywhere on your
<b>local</b> network, enter its name or IP address as a 'spamassassin' entry.
 This may be (and, in fact, will usually be) <tt>127.0.0.1</tt> to specify
that the service is running on the same host computer as the Citadel server.</p>
          
<p>Please install SpamAssassin as per its own documentation.  You will want 
  to run SpamAssassin in client/server mode, where a <tt>spamd</tt> daemon
  is always running on your computer.  Citadel does not utilize the <tt>spamc</tt> 
  client; instead, it implements SpamAssassin's protocol on its own.</p>
          
<p>Connecting to a SpamAssassin service across a wide area network is strongly
  discouraged.  In order to determine whether an incoming e-mail is spam,
Citadel  must feed the <i>entire message</i> to the SpamAssassin service.
 Doing this  over a wide area network would consume time and bandwidth, which
would affect  performance.</p>
          
<p>Citadel invokes the SpamAssassin service when incoming messages are arriving
  via SMTP.  Before a message is accepted, it is submitted to SpamAssassin.
   If SpamAssassin determines that the message is spam, the Citadel SMTP
service   <i>rejects the message,</i> causing a delivery failure on the sending
host.    This is superior to software which files away spam in a separate
folder,   because delivery failures will cause some spammers to assume the
address  is invalid and remove it from their mailing lists.</p>
          
<p>Now select <tt><b>S</b>ave</tt> and you are just about ready for Internet
  e-mail.</p>
          
<h3><a name="Enabling_the_Internet_mail_protocols"></a>Enabling the Internet 
  mail protocols</h3>
          
<p>As previously mentioned, Citadel contains its own SMTP, POP3, and IMAP 
  services.  Enabling them is simple.</p>
          
<p>Check for the existance of a current MTA (sendmail, qmail, etc.) by connecting
  to port 25 on your host. If you see something similar to the following
you're   running an MTA already and you'll need to shut it down:</p>
          
<pre>smw @ pixel % telnet localhost 25<br>Trying 127.0.0.1...<br>Connected to localhost.<br>Escape character is '^]'.<br>220 pixel.citadel.org ESMTP Sendmail 8.9.3/8.9.3; Wed, 15 Mar 2000 19:00:53 -0500<br></pre>
          
<p>In the above example, we see that the host already has Sendmail listening 
  on port 25.  Before Citadel can use port 25, Sendmail must be shut off. 
Please consult the documentation for your operating system for instructions 
on how to do this.  (On a Red Hat Linux system, for example, you can run the
<tt>ntsysv</tt> utility, un-checking <tt>sendmail</tt> to disable it at the
next reboot; then, run <tt>service sendmail stop</tt> to shut off the currently
running service.)</p>
          
<p>If you get a 'connection refused' message when you telnet to port 25 there's
   nothing running and you should be able to continue. You might also want
 to turn off POP (try the above test substituting 110 for 25) and IMAP (port
 143) and use Citadel's POP and IMAP services.</p>
          
<p>Citadel will look for an existing pop/smtp server on startup. If they
don't  exist (and you've configured them properly) then Citadel should  enable
them at startup.  You can check your logs to be sure, or you can  start the
server from a shell and watch it load.  It might look something like this:</p>

<p>The lines emphasized in boldface in the above log output tell you that 
  Citadel "can't bind" to various ports.  The error 'address already in use' 
  generally means that something else is already running on the requested 
port.  Make SURE you've followed the above steps to remove sendmail/pop and 
 start your Citadel server again.</p>
          
<h3><a name="citmail"></a>Using Citadel in conjunction with another MTA</h3>
          
<p>Occationally it is not practical to remove a non-Citadel MTA on your host
  system.  For example, you might have multiple groups of users, some of
which   are using Citadel and some of which are using a legacy Unix mail
spool. This  type of configuration is discouraged, but a tool is provided
to allow it.</p>
          
<p>The tool is called <tt>citmail</tt> and it is, quite simply, a local MDA 
  (Mail Delivery Agent) which you can configure into your MTA for final delivery
  of incoming messages to Citadel users.  A full discussion of the finer
points   of complex Sendmail configurations is beyond the scope of this document; 
 however, you might want to visit <a
 href="http://pixel.citadel.org/citadel/docs/">Pixel BBS</a> where some useful
 HOWTO documents are provided.</p>
          
<p>For outbound mail, you can either allow Citadel to perform deliveries directly
(this won't affect your other mail system because outbound mail doesn't tie
up port 25) or enter <tt>127.0.0.1</tt> as your smart-host, which will tell
Citadel to forward all of its outbound mail to your other mail system.</p>
          
<h3><a name="Hosting_an_Internet_mailing_list"></a>Hosting an Internet mailing 
 list</h3>
      
<p>Citadel has built in mailing list service (known in the 'net vernacular 
 as "listserv") functionality. &nbsp;You can turn any room into a mailing 
list. &nbsp;Users can then choose how they participate -- by logging on to 
your Citadel server directly, or by having the room's contents mailed to them
somewhere else. &nbsp;Configuring this is easy.</p>
      
<p>Citadel supports two modes of mailing list delivery: </p>
   
<ul>
     <li>"List mode" -- each individual message is delivered as a single
e-mail  to each list mode recipient. &nbsp;The "From:" header will display
the address  of the message's original author.</li>
     <li>"Digest mode" -- groups of one or more messages are delivered to 
digest  mode recipients. &nbsp;The number of messages in the group depends 
on how  many new messages arrived since the last batch was delivered. &nbsp;The 
"From:"  header will display the address of the room itself, which allows 
replies to be posted back to the room.</li>
     
</ul>
   A room may have any combination of list mode and digest mode recipients.
      
<p>As alluded to above, every room on your Citadel system has an Internet
 e-mail address of its own. &nbsp;Messages sent to that address will be posted
 in the room (and sent back out to mailing list recipients, as well as to
any other Citadels you share the room with). &nbsp;The address format is
<tt>room_</tt> plus the name of the room, with any spaces replaced by underscores,
followed by <tt>@</tt> and your hostname. For example, if your system is
known as <tt>phlargmalb.orc.org</tt> on the Internet, and you have a room
 called <tt>Bubblegum Collectors</tt>, you can post to that room from anywhere
on the Internet simply by sending an e-mail to <tt>room_bubblegum_collectors@phlargmalb.orc.org</tt>. 
 When the message arrives, it's automatically posted in that room.</p>
      
<p>To manually edit the list of "list mode" recipients, simply enter the <tt><b>.A</b>ide
mailing <b>L</b>ist management</tt> command.  Your text editor will open
up and you will be able to create or edit a list of recipients, one per line.
 Lines beginning with a hash (<tt>#</tt>) are comments.</p>
      
<p>To manually edit the list of "digest mode" recipients, enter the <tt><b>.A</b>ide
 mailing list <b>D</b>igest recipients</tt> command.  As with the previous
 command, the text editor will open up and you can edit the list of digest
 mode recipients, one per line.</p>
      
<p>Citadel also has a facility which allows users to subscribe or unsubscribe 
 to mailing lists using a web browser.  In order to do this, WebCit must also
 be running on your server in addition to Citadel.  WebCit is obtained and
 installed separately from the rest of the Citadel system.</p>
      
<p>In order to prevent "just anyone" from subscribing to any room on your 
 system, there is a setting in the <tt><b>.A</b>ide <b>E</b>dit room</tt> 
command:</p>
      
<pre>CitaNews} . Aide Edit this room<br>Room name [CitaNews]:<br><br><i>(lots of other stuff omitted for brevity...)</i><br><br>Self-service list subscribe/unsubscribe [No]: Yes<br></pre>
      
<p>When you answer "Yes" to self-service list subscribe/unsubscribe, you are
enabling that feature.  Now, all you have to do is tell the world about the
web page they need to visit.  It looks like this:</p>
       
<center><tt>http://foobar.baz.org:2000/listsub</tt></center>
       
<p>In this example, the server is called <tt>foobar.baz.org</tt> and WebCit 
 is running on port 2000.  Edit appropriately.</p>
      
<p>Citadel offers a subscribe/unsubscribe facility that is more intuitive 
 than other listservs.  With most systems, sending commands to the listserv 
 requires that you e-mail it commands in a special format.  It's easy to get
it wrong.  Citadel simply uses your web browser.  You select the list you
want to subscribe or unsubscribe (hint: it's the list of rooms you've enabled
self-service for), select whether you want list mode or digest mode, and
enter your e-mail address.  For security purposes, a confirmation message
 is sent to the address you enter.  But you don't have to reply to the message
 in a weird format, either: the confirmation contains another URL which you
 simply click on (or paste into your browser if you can't click on URL's
in  your e-mail software) and the confirmation is automatically completed.</p>

<h2><a name="Building_or_joining_a_Citadel_network"></a>Building or joining
  a Citadel network</h2>
    </center>
          
<h3><a name="Overview__"></a>Overview</h3>
          
<p>If you are running Citadel as a BBS or other forum type of application, 
  one way to 'keep the conversation going' is to share rooms with other Citadel
  systems. In a shared room, a message posted to the room is automatically
 propagated to every system on the network.  It's kind of like a UseNet newsgroup,
 but without the spam.</p>
          
<p>If you are using Citadel as the e-mail and groupware platform for a large
  organization, you can use its networking features to build a large network
  of Citadel servers which share content (think of rooms as public folders),
  redistribute e-mail throughout the organization, and integrate the global
  address book. &nbsp;It might make sense, for example, in a large corporation
  to give each department or location its own Citadel server. &nbsp;Thanks
 to Citadel's global address book features, you could still have all of the
 users share a single e-mail domain.</p>
           
<p>Obviously, the first thing you have to do is find another Citadel to share 
  rooms with, and make arrangements with them.  The following Citadels are
  a good place to start:</p>
           
<ul>
     <li>UNCENSORED! - <a href="http://uncensored.citadel.org">uncensored.citadel.org</a> 
    </li>
      <li>The Dog Pound II - <a href="http://dogpound2.citadel.org">dogpound2.citadel.org</a> 
    </li>
      <li>PixelBBS - <a href="http://pixel.citadel.org">pixel.citadel.org</a> 
    </li>
       
</ul>
           
<p>You don't have to be a part of the citadel.org domain to participate in
  the public Citadel network, but the DNS service is provided free of charge
  by the Citadel community if you wish to do this.</p>
          
<h3><a name="Conventions_and_etiquette_when"></a>Conventions and etiquette
  when connecting to the public Citadel network</h3>
           
<p>Before we get into the technical nitty gritty, there are two points of 
  etiquette to keep in mind.  The first thing to keep in mind is that the 
operator of any particular Citadel may not be willing to share some of his/her 
rooms.  Some sites are proud to offer exclusive content in certain areas. 
Chances are, if a room is already being shared on the network, it's available 
for anyone to share; if not, it can't hurt to ask -- but take care not to 
demand it of them.  Ask if you may share the room instead of telling them 
that you wish to share the room.  When looking at a <tt><b>K</b></tt>nown 
rooms list, network rooms are the ones ending in parentheses instead of angle 
brackets.  For example, <tt>Gateway)</tt> would be a network room, <tt>Lobby&gt;</tt> 
  would not.</p>
           
<p>The other point of etiquette to remember is that you should be making
the arrangements in advance, and then set it up.  It is extremely rude to
simply begin networking with another Citadel, or unilaterally start sharing
a new room, without first obtaining permission from its operator.  Always
ask first.  Most Citadel operators are more than happy to network with you.
 Also, if later on you decide to take your system down, please take the time
to notify the operators of any other Citadels you network with, so they can
unconfigure their end.</p>
          
<h3><a name="Getting_ready_to_join_the_network"></a>Getting ready to join
  the network</h3>
           
<p>Ok, first things first.  On a Citadel room sharing network, the first
thing you need to know is your own system's node name.  Presumably you set
this up during installation, but if you want to change it you can do so using
the <tt><b>.A</b>ide <b>S</b>ysconfig <b>G</b>eneral</tt> command:</p>
          
<pre>Lobby&gt; . Aide System configuration General<br>Node name [uncnsrd]:<br>Fully qualified domain name [uncensored.citadel.org]:<br>Human readable node name [Uncensored]:<br></pre>
           
<p>The "node name" is important, it's how the network identifies messages 
  coming from your system.  The "human readable node name" is simply a label; 
  it shows up in messages coming from your system.  "Fully qualified domain 
  name" is your DNS name; it's used for routing messages on the Internet. 
In the above example, the node name is "uncnsrd".</p>
          
<h3><a name="Defining_neighbor_nodes"></a>Defining neighbor nodes</h3>
           
<p>The next thing you need to do is configure your neighbor node(s).  You
  need to do this for each node you network with.  Let's say you wanted to
 talk to a Citadel system called "frobozz".  Use the <tt><b>.A</b>ide <b>S</b>ysconfig
  <b>N</b>etwork</tt> command:</p>
          
<pre>Lobby&gt; . Aide System configuration Network<br>###    Node            Secret                   Host or IP             Port#<br>--- ---------------- ---------------- -------------------------------- -----<br>&lt;A&gt;dd &lt;D&gt;elete &lt;S&gt;ave &lt;Q&gt;uit  -&gt; Add<br><br>Enter node name    : frobozz<br>Enter shared secret: frotz<br>Enter host or IP   : frobozz.magick.org<br>Enter port number  :  [504]: 504<br><br>###    Node            Secret                   Host or IP             Port#<br>--- ---------------- ---------------- -------------------------------- -----<br>  1 frobozz          frotz            frobozz.magick.org               504<br>&lt;A&gt;dd &lt;D&gt;elete &lt;S&gt;ave &lt;Q&gt;uit  -&gt; Save<br><br>Lobby&gt;<br></pre>
          
<p>As you can see in the above example, you have to enter the Citadel node
  name, the DNS name or IP address of the server, and the port number the
Citadel  service is running on.  The "shared secret" is a password to allow
the two  Citadel nodes to connect to each other to exchange network data.
 The password  must be <i>identical</i> on both ends of the connection --
when the operator  of the other Citadel node sets up the connection with
your system, he/she  must use the same password.</p>
          
<h3><a name="Sharing_rooms"></a>Sharing rooms</h3>
           
<p>Now you're ready to share rooms.  You have to do this for each room you
  want to share, and you have to do it from BOTH ENDS -- again, when you
share   a room with another Citadel, they must share it with you as well.
 Let's  say you have a room called "Quiche Recipes&gt;" and you want to share
it with the node you set up above.  First, edit the room and flag it as a
network   room:</p>
          
<pre>Quiche Recipes&gt; . Aide Edit this room<br>Room name [Quiche Recipes]:<br>Private room  [No]: No<br>Preferred users only  [No]: No<br>Read-only room  [No]: No<br>Directory room  [No]: No<br>Permanent room  [No]: No<br>Network shared room  [No]: Yes<br>Automatically make all messages anonymous  [No]: No<br>Ask users whether to make messages anonymous  [No]: No<br>Listing order [64]:<br>Room aide (or 'none') [none]:<br>Message expire policy (? for list) [0]:<br>Save changes (y/n)? Yes<br>Ok<br><br>Quiche Recipes)<br></pre>
           
<p>Notice how the prompt changed?  It was &gt; before, but it's ) now. That
  means it's a network room.  Now you can tell Citadel that you want to share
  the room with frobozz.  Enter this command:</p>
          
<pre>Quiche Recipes) . Aide Network room sharing<br></pre>
           
<p>Your text editor will pop up (you <i>did</i> configure Citadel to use
your favorite text editor, right?) with a screen that looks like this:</p>
          
<pre># Configuration for room: Quiche Recipes<br># Nodes with which we share this room<br># Specify one per line.<br></pre>
          
<p>All you have to do is enter the name of the other Citadel node (i.e. "frobozz"
  in our example) on a line by itself.  As usual, lines starting with a "#"
  are comments.  Just go to the end of the file, type "frobozz" (without
the   quotes), save the file... and you're done!</p>
           
<p>At this point, you just sit back and enjoy.  Your Citadel and the other
  one will begin polling each other at regular intervals (once per hour by
 default) and sharing messages.</p>
          
<h3><a name="Sending_mail"></a>Sending mail</h3>
          
<p>You can send mail to any user on any node of your Citadel network.  It 
  may take a little while for your system to learn the entire node list, though,
  as this is done by watching incoming messages on the network and learning
  which nodes are out there.</p>
          
<p>To send a private message, just enter <tt>user @ host</tt> as the recipient:</p>
          
<pre>Mail&gt; Enter message                                                            <br>Enter recipient: Some other user @ frobozz<br> Feb 11 2003 11:36pm from I. M. Me to Some other user @ frobozz<br>type message here...<br><br>Entry command (? for options)  -&gt;<br></pre>
          
<h3><a name="Changing_the_polling_interval"></a>Changing the polling interval</h3>
          
<p>As previously mentioned, Citadel will poll other Citadel nodes for messages 
  once per hour.  If this is not an acceptable interval, you can change it 
 using the <tt><b>.A</b>ide <b>S</b>ystem configuration <b>G</b>eneral</tt> 
 command.  Enter this command and look for the option:</p>
          
<pre>How often to run network jobs (in seconds) [3600]:<br></pre>
          
<p>Change it to whatever you like.  For example, 15 minutes is 900 seconds.
   So if you changed the default value to 900, network polling would occur
 every 15 minutes.</p>
          
<hr>      
<h2 align="center"><a name="Database_maintenance"></a>Database maintenance</h2>
   
<h3><a name="Introduction_"></a>Introduction</h3>
  The data store used by Citadel is reliable and self-maintaining. &nbsp;It
 requires very little maintenance. &nbsp;This is primarily due to its use
of the <a href="http://www.sleepycat.com">Berkeley DB</a> record manager.
&nbsp;It is robust, high-performance, and transactional.<br>
  <br>
  A few small data files are kept in your main Citadel directory, but the 
databases are in the <tt>data/</tt> subdirectory. &nbsp;The files with names 
that begin with "cdb" are the databases themselves; the files with names that
begin with "log" are the journals. &nbsp;Journal files will come and go as
you use your system; when the database engine has determined that a particular
log file is no longer needed, the file will automatically be deleted. &nbsp;Nevertheless,
you should always ensure that there is ample disk space for the files to
grow.<br>
 <br>
 There is no need to shut down Citadel during backups. &nbsp;The data store 
may be backed up "hot." &nbsp;The makers of Berkeley DB suggest that you should
back up the data files <i>first</i> and the log files <i>second</i>. &nbsp;This
is the only method that will guarantee that a database which is being changed
while you back it up will still be usable when you restore it from the tape
later.<br>
  <br>
   
<h3><a name="Database_repair"></a>Database repair</h3>
  Although Citadel's data store is quite reliable, database corruption can 
occur in rare instances. &nbsp;External factors such as an operating system 
crash or an unexpected loss of power might leave the database in an unknown 
state. &nbsp;A utility is provided which may be able to repair your database 
if this occurs. &nbsp;If you find that your Citadel server is not running, 
and reading the logs shows that it is crashing because of an inability to 
validate a database, follow these steps:<br>
 
<ol>
   <li>Edit <tt>/etc/inittab</tt> and switch the Citadel service from "respawn"
to "off." &nbsp;Type <tt>init q</tt> to make this setting permanent.</li>
   <li><b>Make a backup of your data.</b> &nbsp;Either write it out to tape 
or copy it to another directory, or a tarball.<br>
   </li>
   <li><tt>cd</tt> to your Citadel directory and type <tt>./database_cleanup.sh</tt></li>
   <li>Edit <tt>/etc/inittab</tt> and switch the Citadel service from "off"
to "respawn". &nbsp;Type <tt>init q</tt> to activate your changes.</li>
 
</ol>
 If this procedure does not work, you must restore from your most recent
backup.<br>
  <br>
   
<h3><a name="ImportingExporting_your_Citadel"></a>Importing/Exporting your
 Citadel database<br>
  </h3>
   
<p>Citadel/UX now contains an importer/exporter module, affectionaly known
 as the "Art Vandelay" module (a not-so-obscure Seinfeld reference).  It
allows  you to export the entire contents of your Citadel databases to a
flat file,  which may then be imported on another system.  (This procedure
is also known  as "dump and load" to some database gurus.)</p>
       
<p>Why would you want to do this?  Here are some scenarios: </p>
   
<ul>
   <li>You are moving a Citadel installation to another computer, which uses
 a different CPU.  Since Citadel stores data in an architecture-dependent 
format, the data files wouldn't work on the new computer as-is. </li>
    <li>Your computer crashed, lost power, etc. and you suspect that your 
databases have become corrupted. </li>
    <li>You want to switch to a different back-end data store.  (For example,
 from GDBM to Berkeley DB) </li>
   
</ul>
        
<p>So ... how do we work this magic?  Follow these steps <i>exactly</i> as 
 documented and you should be able to do it all with very little trouble.</p>
      
<ol>
    <li>This should be obvious, but it's still worth mentioning: MAKE SURE
 YOU TAKE A BACKUP OF EVERYTHING BEFORE YOU START THIS!!  You're performing
 a major operation here.  Don't risk it.  </li>
    <li>First, get all the users logged off from your system.  Disconnect 
it  from the network if possible.  You don't want anyone logging in while 
you're doing this.  </li>
    <li>Log on as root, or some other user that has read/write access to
all  relevant files.  </li>
    <li>Go to the directory that Citadel is installed in.  For example, issue
 a command like <tt>cd /usr/local/citadel</tt>  </li>
    <li>Export the databases with the following command:<br>
   <br>
   <tt>./sendcommand "ARTV export" &gt;exported.dat</tt><br>
   <br>
   This command may run for a while.  On a very large system it could take 
an hour or more.  Please be patient!  </li>
    <li>When the export completes, check to make sure that <tt>exported.dat</tt>
 exists and has some data in it. (Type "ls -l exported.dat")  </li>
    <li>Shut down the Citadel server.  If you have a line in <tt>/etc/inittab</tt> 
 that reads like this:<br>
   <br>
   <tt>c1:2345:respawn:/usr/local/citadel/citserver -h/usr/local/citadel</tt> 
     <br>
   ...then you should change the <tt>respawn</tt> to <tt>off</tt> and then
 type <tt>/sbin/init q</tt> to make the changes take effect.  </li>
    <li>Now it's time to delete your current binary databases.  Type:<br>
   <br>
    <tt>rm -f citadel.config citadel.control data/*</tt>  </li>
    <li>If you're moving Citadel to another computer, you should move the 
    <i>entire</i> directory over at this time. <tt>exported.dat</tt> only 
contains the information that was in the binary databases.  Information which 
was stored in portable formats doesn't need to be exported/imported, so you 
must bring it all over in its current form.  </li>
    <li>Now get Citadel running on the new computer (or whatever).  Run <tt>setup</tt>
 and turn the service back on (from <tt>/etc/inittab</tt>) but DO NOT log
in.  </li>
    <li>As root, run the import command:<br>
   <br>
   <tt>./sendcommand "ARTV import" &lt;exported.dat</tt><br>
   <br>
   This will import your databases.  Again, it may run for a long time. 
  </li>
    <li>Restart the Citadel server.  You can do this any way you like.  From 
 the command line, you can do it with a command like:<br>
   <br>
    <tt>./sendcommand "DOWN"</tt> <br>
   </li>
    <li>Now you're finished.  Log in and test everything.  You may delete 
exported.dat at this time, or you might want to save it somewhere as a sort 
of pseudo-backup.    </li>
</ol>

<center><h2><a name="utilities"></a>Utilities</center></h2>

<h3><a name="overview"></a>Overview</h3>

<P>The following utilities will be discussed:
<UL>
<LI><b>aidepost</b> - Post standard input to the Aide&gt; room
<LI><b>whobbs</b> - Who is on the system
<LI><b>stats</b> - Print the calling statistics &amp; graph
<LI><b>msgform</b> - Format a binary message to the screen (stdin or in a file)
<LI><b>userlist</b> - Print the userlist
<LI><b>readlog</b> - Read the caller log
<LI><b>sendcommand</b> - Send a server command
</UL></p>

<p>It is up to you to decide which utilities should be made accessible only
to system administrators.
It is important that you set the file permissions correctly.  All
utilities should have access to the Citadel data files.  We will attempt to
address each program individually.</p>
  
<h3><a name="aidepost"></a>aidepost</h3>

<p>The nature of this program is rather simple. Standard input (stdin) is
converted into a message, filed in the main message store, and posted
in the Aide&gt; room.  This is useful for keeping transcripts of system
activity that has to do with Citadel operations.
You might even elect to send all of your system
logs there, too.</p>
 
<p><tt>aidepost</tt> also accepts the usage <tt>aidepost -rTargetRoom</tt>,
where TargetRoom
is the name of a room to which you'd like the message to be sent.</p>

<h3><a name="whobbs"></a>whobbs</h3>

<p>This program is similar to the <tt>who</tt> command.
It lists all of the users
who are currently connected to your Citadel server, either locally or across a
network.  Unless you're running a standalone system,
<tt>who</tt> and <tt>whobbs</tt> will
probably not have a one-to-one correspondence.  Remember that you will see
sessions for SMTP, POP, and IMAP users, as well as users running a
Citadel client.</p>
 
<p>One thing to keep in mind is that the <tt>whobbs</tt> utility
actually opens a
connection to the server.  If the server is maxed out,
<tt>whobbs</tt> will still be
able to provide a listing, because it doesn't need to log in to execute the
<tt>RWHO</tt> command.  Note that whobbs does not list its own session.</p>
 
<p>The <tt>whobbs</tt> utility is smart enough
to know when it is being invoked by a
web server as a CGI program.  In this situation, it will output its listing as
a nicely formatted web page instead of plain text.  This makes it easy to just
put a link to the whobbs binary in your cgi-bin directory, allowing a quick and
easy way for web surfers to see who is online.</p>
 
<p>Running the <tt><b>W</b>ho is online</tt> command
from the Citadel client does <b>not</b> call this
utility.  It has this functionality built in.</p>
  
<h3><a name="stats"></a>stats</h3> 

<p>This program displays
various statistics on the screen based on the calllog file, such as number
of connects, number of logins, number of logouts, number of disconnects,
bad password attempts, etc. All statistics are provided in three figures:
times per call, times per day, and total times.</p>

<p>After this screen appears, you may press return for the next screen. This
is a graphic representation of system usage, broken down into 20 minute
segments of the day.  This will show you when your peak usage is.</p>

<p>Press return again and the stats program will list your system's top
20 callers.</p>

<p>The final screen lists the twenty users with the highest post per call
ratios.  Unline the other screens, this statistic is extracted from the user
file itself rather than the call log.</p>
 
<p><tt>stats</tt> may be called with the <tt>-b</tt> option to
run in batch mode.  In this case,
it skips all the prompts and just prints everything out in one bulk output.
Or it may be called with the <tt>-p</tt> option to only print the Post-to-Call
ratios and nothing else.  These options may be useful for embedding the
output of <tt>stats</tt> in a batch report or a web page.</p>

<p>Nearly all of the statistics displayed by the <tt>stats</tt> utility
are completely wrong.</p>

<h3><a name="msgform"></a>msgform</h3>

<p>The <tt>msgform</tt> utility reads its standard input (stdin) looking for
Citadel messages stored in the internal format used on disk and over the
network, and sends them in a human-readable format to standard output
(stdout).  There is no longer much use for this program, but it is included
for hack value.</p>

<h3><a name="userlist"></a>userlist</h3>

<p>This is a program to print the userlist. There are two flags that may be
set when running this program. When called without any arguments,
<tt>userlist</tt> will display all users (except those who have chosen to
be unlisted), their user numbers, times called, messages posted, screen
width, and date of their most recent call.</p>
 
<p><tt>userlist</tt> is simply the same user listing code that is in the
client, made into a standalone utility for convenience.</p>

<h3><a name="readlog"></a>readlog</h3>
   
<p>Called without any arguments, <tt>readlog</tt> dumps the contents of the
call log file. This file records all logins to the Citadel server, as
well as some other statistics.</p>

<h3><a name="sendcommand"></a>sendcommand</h3>
     
<p><tt>sendcommand</tt> will interpret its arguments (except for
<tt>-hDIRNAME</tt>) as a server command, which is sent to the server. 
Commands which require textual input will read it from stdin.  Commands
which generate textual output will be sent to stdout.</p>
 
<p>This utility is intended to be used to enable Citadel server commands to
be executed from shell scripts.  Review the script called <tt>weekly</tt>
which ships with the Citadel distribution for an example of how this can
be used.</p>
 
<p><b>NOTE:</b> be sure that this utility is not world-executable.  It
connects to the server in privileged mode, and therefore could present a
security hole if not properly restricted.</p>
