<pre>Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.  <br>59 Temple Place - Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307, USA<br><br>Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br>of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br></pre>
              
<h3 align="justify">Preamble</h3>
         
<div align="justify">  </div>
         
<p align="justify">   The licenses for most software are designed to take 
  away your freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General 
Public  License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change 
free software--to  make sure the software is free for all its users.  This 
General Public License  applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's 
software and to any other  program whose authors commit to using it.  (Some 
other Free Software Foundation  software is covered by the GNU Library General 
Public License instead.)  You can apply it to your programs, too.  </p>
         
<div align="justify"> </div>
         
<p align="justify">    When we speak of free software, we are referring to 
  freedom, not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure 
  that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge 
  for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
  if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in
new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.  </p>
         
<div align="justify"> </div>
         
<p align="justify">   To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions 
  that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the
  rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you
 if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.  </p>
         
<div align="justify"> </div>
         
<p align="justify">   For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, 
  whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights 
 that you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the 
  source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights. 
   </p>
         
<div align="justify"> </div>
         
<p align="justify">   We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright 
  the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission 
  to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.  </p>
         
<div align="justify"> </div>
         
<p align="justify">   Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want 
  to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for 
this  free software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed 
on,  we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, 
so  that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
  authors' reputations.   </p>
         
<div align="justify"> </div>
         
<p align="justify">   Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by
software patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program
proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any  patent must
be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.  </p>
         
<div align="justify"> </div>
         
<p align="justify">   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution 
  and modification follow.  </p>
         
<div align="justify">   </div>
         
<h3>TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</h3>
         
<div align="justify">   </div>
         
<p align="justify">  <strong>0.</strong>  This License applies to any program 
  or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying 
  it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License.  The
  "Program", below, refers to any such program or work, and a "work based 
on  the Program" means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright 
  law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either
  verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language. 
 (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term "modification".) 
  Each licensee is addressed as "you". </p>
         
<p align="justify">  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification 
  are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
  running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is   covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program
(independent   of having been made by running the Program). Whether that
is true depends   on what the Program does.  </p>
         
<p align="justify">  <strong>1.</strong>  You may copy and distribute verbatim 
  copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided 
  that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
   copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices 
  that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give 
any  other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the 
Program.  </p>
         
<p align="justify">  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring 
  a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange 
 for a fee. </p>
         
<p align="justify">  <strong>2.</strong>  You may modify your copy or copies 
  of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, 
  and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 
  1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions: </p>
         
<p align="justify">  </p>
         
<div align="justify">     
<ul>
       <li><strong>a)</strong>      You must cause the modified files to
carry   prominent notices      stating that you changed the files and the
date of   any change.                           
    <p> </p>
       </li>
       <li><strong>b)</strong>      You must cause any work that you distribute 
  or publish, that in      whole or in part contains or is derived from the 
  Program or any      part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge 
 to all third      parties under the terms of this License.              
             
    <p> </p>
       </li>
       <li><strong>c)</strong>      If the modified program normally reads
 commands  interactively      when run, you must cause it, when started running
 for such      interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display
 an       announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a  
   notice  that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide  
   a warranty)  and that users may redistribute the program under      these
 conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this      License.
  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but      does not normally
 print such an announcement, your work based on      the Program is not required
 to print  an announcement.) </li>
         
</ul>
       These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If identifiable 
  sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably 
  considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, 
  and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as
  separate works.  But when you distribute the same sections as part of a
whole  which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole 
must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees 
extend  to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of 
who wrote  it. </div>
         
<p align="justify">  Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights
or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent
is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective
works based on the Program. </p>
         
<p align="justify">  In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based 
  on the Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on 
 a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work 
 under the scope of this License.  </p>
         
<p align="justify">  <strong>3.</strong>   You may copy and distribute the 
  Program (or a work based on it, under Section 2) in object code or executable 
  form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do 
 one of the following:   <!-- we use this doubled UL to get the sub-sections indented, -->
   <!-- while making the bullets as unobvious as possible. --> </p>
         
<div align="justify">     
<ul>
       <li><strong>a)</strong>      Accompany it with the complete corresponding 
  machine-readable      source code, which must be distributed under the terms
  of Sections      1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software 
 interchange; or,                           
    <p> </p>
       </li>
       <li><strong>b)</strong>      Accompany it with a written offer, valid
  for at least three      years, to give any third party, for a charge no
more  than your      cost of physically performing source distribution, a
complete        machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to
be      distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
     customarily used for software interchange; or,                     
     
    <p> </p>
       </li>
       <li><strong>c)</strong>       Accompany it with the information you
 received  as to the offer      to distribute corresponding source code.
 (This alternative  is      allowed only for noncommercial distribution and
only if you      received the program in object code or executable form with
such      an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.) </li>
         
</ul>
       The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
 making  modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source code
 means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
 interface  definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
 and installation  of the executable.  However, as a special exception, the
 source code distributed  need not include anything that is normally distributed
 (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel,
 and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless
that  component itself  accompanies the executable. </div>
         
<p align="justify">  If distribution of executable or object code is made 
  by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
   access to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution 
  of the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy 
the  source along with the object code. </p>
         
<p align="justify">  <strong>4.</strong>  You may not copy, modify, sublicense, 
  or distribute the Program except as expressly provided under this License. 
   Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program 
  is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
   However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this 
  License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties 
remain  in full compliance.  </p>
         
<p align="justify">  <strong>5.</strong>   You are not required to accept 
  this License, since you have not signed it.  However, nothing else grants 
  you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works. 
   These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. 
 Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on 
 the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and 
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program 
 or works based on it.  </p>
         
<p align="justify">  <strong>6.</strong>  Each time you redistribute the Program
(or any work based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a
license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program 
  subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further restrictions
  on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible
  for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.  </p>
         
<p align="justify">  <strong>7.</strong>  If, as a consequence of a court 
  judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not 
  limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court 
  order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, 
  they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
   distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License  and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
not distribute  the Program at all.  For example, if a patent license would
not permit royalty-free  redistribution of the Program by all those who receive
copies directly or  indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy
both it and this  License would be to refrain entirely from distribution
of the Program. </p>
         
<p align="justify">  If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable 
  under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended 
  to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
    </p>
         
<p align="justify">  It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to
infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity 
  of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the 
integrity  of the free software distribution system, which is implemented 
by public license practices.  Many people have made generous contributions 
to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance 
on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to 
decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system 
and a licensee cannot impose that choice. </p>
         
<p align="justify">  This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what 
  is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.  </p>
         
<p align="justify">  <strong>8.</strong>  If the distribution and/or use of
the Program is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted
interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program under this
License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among  countries
not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation
as if written in the body of this License.  </p>
         
<p align="justify">  <strong>9.</strong>  The Free Software Foundation may 
  publish revised and/or new versions of the General Public License from time
  to time.  Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
  but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  </p>
         
<p align="justify">  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. 
   If the Program specifies a version number of this License which applies 
 to it and "any later version", you have the option of following the terms 
 and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
 the Free Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version 
number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free
Software Foundation.  </p>
         
<p align="justify">   <strong>10.</strong>  If you wish to incorporate parts 
  of the Program into other free programs whose distribution conditions are 
  different, write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which 
  is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software 
  Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be 
 guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives 
of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
      </p>
         
<p align="justify"><strong>NO WARRANTY</strong></p>
         
<div align="justify">  </div>
         
<p align="justify">  <strong>11.</strong>   BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED 
  FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED 
  BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT 
  HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY 
  OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, 
 THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. 
   THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH 
  YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY 
  SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.  </p>
         
<p align="justify">  <strong>12.</strong>  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY 
  APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY 
 OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE,
 BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL 
OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM 
  (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE 
  OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM

<h3>Overview</h3>
       
<p>Citadel/UX is an advanced, multiuser, client/server, room-based BBS program. 
  It is designed to handle the needs of both small dialup systems and large-scale 
 Internet-connected systems.  It was originally developed on an Altos system 
 running Xenix, and has been installed and tested on various Unix and Unix-like 
 platforms.  The author's current development environment (and BBS) is an 
ordinary Linux system.  The current distribution includes: </p>
     
<ul>
    <li>The Citadel/UX server (this is the back end that does all processing)
    </li>
     <li>A text-based client program designed with the traditional Citadel
 "look  and feel" (room prompts, dot commands, and the like) </li>
     <li>Setup programs </li>
     <li>A set of utilities for system administration and maintenance </li>
     <li>Documentation </li>
     
</ul>
        
<p>Some knowledge of the Unix system is necessary to install and manage the
  system. It is mandatory that the sysop have "root" access to the operating
  system. The following are required to install Citadel/UX: </p>
     
<ul>
    <li>A Unix operating system (Linux, BSD, Solaris, Tru64, HP/UX) </li>
     <li>C compiler (such as gcc or egcs) and "make" </li>
     <li>POSIX threads (the "pthreads" library) </li>
     <li>TCP/IP </li>
     <li><a href="http://www.sleepycat.com">Berkeley DB</a> v4.1 or newer 
(GDBM  also works, but its use is officially depracated.  If you are building 
a new system, do <i>not</i> use GDBM.  If you have an existing system which 
uses GDBM, you should migrate it to Berkeley DB as soon as possible.) </li>
     <li>Enough disk space to hold all of the programs and data </li>
     
</ul>
         
<p>If you are running Citadel/UX on a Linux system, it is STRONGLY recommended
  that you run it on a recent distribution (such as  <a
 href="http://www.redhat.com">Red Hat</a> 7.3 or newer).  A new-ish distribution 
 will have most or all of the prerequisite tools and libraries already integrated 
 for you.</p>
             
<h3>Now available:</h3>
        
<ul>
    <li>"WebCit", a gateway program to allow full access to Citadel via the
 World Wide Web.  Interactive access through any Web browser. </li>
     <li>Access to Citadel via *any* standards-compliant e-mail program,
thanks  to Citadel's built-in SMTP, POP, and IMAP services. </li>
     
</ul>
         
<h3>Coming soon:</h3>
       
<ul>
    <li>Newer and better GUI-based clients. </li>
     
</ul>
      
<h3>Everything in its place...</h3>
      
<p>Hopefully you've unpacked the distribution archive into its own directory.
 This is the directory in which all Citadel files are located and in which
 all activity will take place.  Several subdirectories have already been
created  during the unpacking process, and others may be created by the software
if  needed.  Make sure you have Berkeley DB installed on your system, and
that  you have all the development libraries and headers in place so that
you can  compile against them.  If you don't, you can get the latest Berkeley
DB at  <a href="http://www.sleepycat.com">http://www.sleepycat.com</a>. 
If your  operating system uses a separate library to support POSIX threads
(pthreads),  make sure that library is installed as well.  This is almost
never the case  with Linux, but some commercial Unix flavors might need it.</p>
  
<h3>The BBS Login</h3>
  
<p>As with many Unix programs, Citadel wants to run under its own user ID. 
Unlike other programs, however, this user ID will do double-duty as a public 
login for your system if you are running a BBS.  This account is typically 
called "bbs" or "citadel" or something to that effect. You will tell Citadel
what the user-id of that account is, and when someone logs in under that
account, Citadel will prompt for a user name.</p>
  
<p>The Citadel user should have a unique uid. The home directory should be
the one your Citadel installation resides in (in this example we will use
/usr/local/citadel) and the shell should be either "citadel" in that directory,
or a script that will start up citadel (you may wish to set up an external
text editor; see below). Example:</p>
  
<pre>bbs::100:1:BBS Login:/usr/local/citadel:/usr/local/citadel/citadel<br></pre>
  
<p>When you run setup later, you will be required to tell it what the Citadel 
user's numeric user ID is, so it knows what user to run as.  If you create 
an account called <tt>bbs</tt>, <tt>guest</tt>, or <tt>citadel</tt>, the
setup program will automatically pick up the user ID by default.</p>
  
<p>For all other users in /etc/passwd, Citadel will automatically set up
an account using the full name (or 'gecos' in Unixspeak) of the user.  It'll
also ignore any password you supply, because it uses the user's password
on the host system.  This allows a 'single sign on' type of environment. Note
that this does have to be enabled at compile time -- it's the configure option
called <tt>--enable-autologin</tt>.  Keep in mind that these users can use
*either* their Citadel login name or their login name on the host computer,
and their password on the host computer.</p>
  
<h3>Bypassing the <tt>login:</tt> prompt</h3>
  
<p>If you normally log in to your host system using some method other than 
telnet (such as ssh), you might want the telnet service to go straight to 
the Citadel BBS, instead of displaying the <tt>login:</tt> prompt first.
 You can do this by having telnetd start citadel directly instead of <tt>/bin/login</tt>. 
This is actually very simple to implement; all you need to do is make a simple
change to your <tt>inetd</tt> or <tt>xinetd</tt> configuration.  Here are
some configuration examples.</p>
  
<p>An example for <tt>inetd</tt> (put the following line in
<tt>/etc/inetd.conf</tt>, 
replacing any existing telnet configuration line already there):</p>
  
<pre>
telnet stream tcp nowait root /usr/sbin/tcpd in.telnetd -L /usr/local/citadel/citadel
</pre>
  
<p>An example for <tt>xinetd</tt> (if you have a file called <tt>/etc/xinetd.d/telnet</tt> 
then simply replace that file with this one):</p>
  
<pre>service telnet
{
	flags           = REUSE
	socket_type     = stream
	wait            = no
	user            = root
	server          = /usr/sbin/in.telnetd
	server_args     = -L /usr/local/citadel/citadel
	log_on_failure  += USERID
	disable         = no
}
</pre>
  
<p>Please make sure you know what you're doing before you install
this!  If you are going to put Citadel somewhere other than <tt>/usr/local/citadel</tt>
then change the directory name accordingly.  If you know of any other local
peculiarities which need to be observed, edit the above configuration accordingly
as well.  And, of course, if you're working remotely, make sure you can successfully
log in using SSH before you start changing your telnet configuration, otherwise
you could lock yourself out of your system (ask any networking specialist
about the dangers of "working inline" -- then pull up a chair and get a fresh
cup of coffee, because you're going to hear some war stories).</p>
  
<h3>Compiling the programs</h3>
  
<p>You can easily compile the Citadel system with the following commands:</p>
  
<pre>
./configure<br>make
make install
</pre>
  
<p>The 'configure' script will generate a Makefile from the Makefile.in,
and it will also write the file "sysdep.h" to your Citadel directory.  Please
do not edit sysdep.h or Makefile.in yourself.  The configure script will
figure out your system dependencies and set everything correctly.</p>
  
<p>Mac OS X 10.1 and later are now supported.  (Sorry, 10.0 cannot
be supported, now or in the future.)  You need to install the Developer Tools
CD, which you can purchase or download for free from
<a href="http://developer.apple.com">http://developer.apple.com</a>. Then run
configure like this:</p>

<pre>
env CC=/usr/bin/cc ./configure (options - see below)
</pre>

<p>By default, the Citadel system will install in <tt>/usr/local/citadel</tt>.
If you wish to place it in a different directory, you can instead do:</p>
  
<pre>
./configure --prefix=/export/home/citadel      (or whatever)
</pre>
  
<p>If you've got Berkeley DB installed in a non-standard location,
you can help the configure script find it by doing something like this:</p>
  
<pre>
./configure --with-db=/usr/local/BerkeleyDB-4.1
</pre>
  
<p>The configure script prefers Berkeley DB if it is available, but
will fall back to GDBM if it has to.</p>
  
<p>File permissions are always a bother to work with. You don't want
Citadel to crash because someone couldn't access a file, but you also don't 
want shell users peeking into the binaries to do things like reading others' 
mail, finding private rooms, etc.  The Citadel server needs to be started 
as root in order to bind to privileged ports, but as soon as its initialization
is finished, it changes its user ID to your BBS user ID in order to avoid
security holes.</p>
  
<h3>Upgrading</h3>

<p>Upgrading to a new version uses the same build procedure as compiling
the program for a fresh install, except that you want to do <tt>make install-exec</tt> 
instead of <tt>make install</tt>.  This will overwrite the programs but not
your data.  <b>Be sure to shut down citserver during this process!</b>  If
Citadel is running while you upgrade, you may face data corruption issues.</p>

<h3>The <tt>citadel.rc</tt> file</h3>
  
<p>The text-based client included with Citadel is suitable for BBS
applications.  Much of its command set and other behavior is configurable
through a Run Control (RC) file. The standard client looks for this file
in the following locations:
<ul>
<li><tt>$HOME/.citadelrc</tt></li>
<li><tt>/usr/local/lib/citadel.rc</tt></li>
<li><i>your-Citadel-directory</i><tt>/citadel.rc</tt></li>
</ul>
The next couple of sections deal with client-side configuration.</p>
 
<h3>Using an external editor for message composition</h3>
  
<p>Citadel/UX has a built-in message editor.  However, you can also
use your favorite text editor to write messages.  To do this you simply put
a line in your citadel.rc file like this:</p>
  
<pre>
editor=/usr/bin/vi
</pre>

<p>The above example would make Citadel call the vi editor when using 
the <tt><b>.E</b>nter <b>E</b>ditor</tt> command. You can also make it the
default editor for the <tt><b>E</b>nter</tt> command by editing the <tt>citadel.rc</tt>
file.  <b>But be warned:</b> external editors on public systems can be a
security hole, because they usually provide users with the ability to drop
into a shell on the host system, or save files using names other than the
name of the temporary file they are editing.  If you intend to use an external
editor on a public BBS, make sure you use one that has been hardened for
such a purpose -- one which has had the 'shell' and 'save as' commands disabled,
as well as any other functions which a destructive user could use to gain
unauthorized access to your host system.</p>
  
<h3>Printing messages</h3>
  
<p>Citadel/UX can send messages to a printer, or just about anywhere
else in your system.  The variable <tt>PRINTCMD</tt> in <tt>citadel.rc</tt>
specifies what command you use to print.  Text is sent to the standard input
(stdin) of the print command.</p>
  
<p>So if you did this:</p>
  
<pre>
printcmd="nl|pr|lpr -Plocal"
</pre>
  
<p>...that would add line numbers, then paginate, then print on the
printer named "local".  There's tons of stuff you can do with this feature.
 For example, you could use a command like <tt>cat &lt;&lt;$HOME/archive</tt>
to save copies of important messages in a textfile.  Again, this is probably
something you don't want to configure for a public BBS host -- most system
administrators don't want remote users sending arbitrary things to local
printers.</p>
  
<h3>URL viewing</h3>
  
<p>This is one more feature which is appropriate for local users.
 While reading a message that has Internet URL's in it, you can select the
<tt><b>U</b>RL-view</tt> command, and it will perform some pre-defined action
(usually, this is to open up the URL in a web browser).  For example:</p>
  
<pre>
urlcmd=netscape -remote "openURL(%s)"
</pre>
  
<p>In the above example, it would open up the URL in an open
<a href="http://www.netscape.com/download">Netscape</a> window.</p>
  
<h3>Setup and login</h3>
  
<p>Before logging in for the first time, you must run the setup program. 
To begin this procedure, enter the following commands:</p>
  
<pre>
cd /usr/local/citadel
./setup
</pre>
  
<p>The setup program will guide you through a simple configuration
procedure. It will ask you what directory to place your data files in --
the default is the current directory, which is usually the sensible thing
to select.  If you want to run more than one instance of Citadel on the same
host, however, you can specify a different directory here -- just remember
to specify the directory name again when you start up the server later on.</p>
  
<p><tt>setup</tt> will then shut down the Citadel service if it is
found to be running.</p>
  
<p>You will then be prompted for the name of the system administrator.
This is not merely a cosmetic option -- when you log in to your system a
little while from now, you'll log in with this name, and it will automatically
assign your account the highest access level.</p>
  
<p>Next, you will be prompted for the User ID of the Citadel account
on your host system.  If you have an account called <tt>bbs</tt>, <tt>guest</tt>,
or <tt>citadel</tt>, that account's UID will be the default.  If you are
upgrading or reconfiguring an existing system, the existing value will be
preserved.</p>
  
<p>Then you will be prompted for a server port number.  This is the
TCP port which Citadel clients use to connect to your Citadel server.  In
almost all cases, you want to use the default -- port 504, which is the official
port number assigned by the IANA for Citadel implementations.</p>
  
<p>The Citadel service will then be started, and you will see the
following message:</p>
  
<pre>
Setup is finished.  You may now log in.
</pre>
  
<p>Setup is now complete, on most systems, anyway.  Please see below
to find out if you need to do anything else:</p>
  
<h3>Configuring your host system to start the service</h3>
  
<p><b>Please note:</b> this topic involves modifications made to
<tt>/etc/services</tt> and <tt>/etc/inittab</tt> in order to configure your
host system to automatically start the Citadel service.  <tt>setup</tt> will
automatically perform these steps if it can, and if you allow it to -- just
answer 'Yes' when prompted, and everything will be taken care of for you.
 If you answer 'No' -- or if your system is a little bit odd (for example,
BSD systems don't have <tt>/etc/inittab</tt>) -- read this section and do
what you need to in order to get things configured.</p>
   
<p>Before you can use Citadel, you must define the "citadel" service
to your  system.  This is accomplished by adding a line to your /etc/services
file that looks something like this:</p>
  
<pre>citadel		504/tcp			# Citadel/UX Server<br></pre>
  
<p>504 is the port number officially designated by the IANA for use
by Citadel.  There should not be any need to use a different port number,
unless you are  running multiple Citadels on the same computer and therefore
need a different port for each one.</p>
  
<p>The next step is to arrange for the server to start.  The <tt>citserver</tt> 
program is the main Citadel server.  Before we cover the recommended method
of starting the server, let's examine its usage options:</p>
  
<pre>citserver [-hHomeDir] [-xDebugLevel] [-tTraceFile] [-d] [-f]<br></pre>
  
<p>The options are as follows:</p>
  
<p><tt>-hHomeDir</tt> - the directory your BBS data files live in.
 This should, of course, be a directory that you've run the <tt>setup</tt>
program against to set up some data files.  If a directory is not specified,
the directory name which was specified in the <tt>Makefile</tt> will be used.</p>
  
<p><tt>-xDebugLevel</tt> - Set the verbosity of trace messages printed.
 The available  debugging levels are: </p>
<ul>
 <li>1 - Internal errors (failed thread creation, malloc problems,
etc.) </li>
  <li>2 - Network errors (broken sockets, failed socket creation) 
    </li>
  <li>3 - Begin and end of sessions, startup/shutdown of server </li>
  <li>5 - Server commands being sent from clients </li>
  <li>7 - Entry and exit of various functions  </li>
  <li>8 - Entry and exit of critical sections </li>
  <li>9 - Various debugging checkpoints (insanely verbose) </li>
</ul>
  
<p><tt>-tTraceFile</tt> - Tell the server where to send its debug/trace
output.   Normally it is sent to stdout.</p>
  
<p><tt>-d</tt> - Run as a daemon; i.e. in the background.  This switch
would be necessary if you were  starting the Citadel server, for example,
from an rc.local script (which is  not recommended, because this won't allow
the server to automatically restart when it is shut down).</p>
  
<p><tt>-f</tt> - Defragment all the databases upon startup.  This
isn't normally necessary due to the nature of the data stored in Citadel,
but the option is provided in case you need it.  (Note that this only applies
to GDBM installations; if you are using Berkeley DB it has no effect.)</p>
  
<p>The preferred method of starting the Citadel server is to place
an entry in your /etc/inittab file.  This will conveniently bring the server
up when your  system is up, and terminate it gracefully when your system
is shutting down.   The exact syntax for your system may vary, but here's
an entry that could be used on a Linux system:</p>
  
<pre>
cit:2345:respawn:/usr/local/citadel/citserver -h/usr/local/citadel -t/dev/tty9 -x3
</pre>
  
<p>In this example, we've chosen debugging level 3, and have the
trace stuff output to one of the virtual consoles.  It's important to remember
to turn off any getty that is set up on that virtual console, if you do this.
 After making this change, the command <tt>init q</tt> works on most systems
to tell init to re-read the file.  If in doubt, just reboot the computer.</p>
  
<h3>Logging in for the first time</h3>
  
<p>At this point, your system is ready to run. Run the <tt>citadel</tt>
program from the shell and log in as a new user.  NOTE: the first user account
to be created will automatically be set to access level 6 (Aide).  This overcomes
some obvious logistical problems - normally, Aide access is given by another
Aide, but since there aren't any on your system yet, this isn't possible.</p>
  
<h3>Welcoming new users</h3>
  
<p>Sometimes you might decide that you want a welcome message (or
several different messages) automatically mailed to new users upon their
first login. Now there is a way to do this.  If you create a room called <tt>New
User Greetings</tt>, and it is a <i>private</i> room (invitation-only probably 
makes the most sense), any messages you enter into that room will automatically 
be delivered to all new users upon registration.</p>
  
<p>You can put anything you want there: a welcome message, system
policies, special information, etc.  You can also put as many messages there
as you want to (although it really doesn't make sense to clutter new users'
mailboxes with lots of junk).</p>
  
<p>Don't worry about wasting disk space, either.  Citadel has a single-instance 
message store, so all the new users are actually looking at the same copy
of the message on disk.</p>
    
<h3>Space for adding your own client features (doors)</h3>
  
<p><b>Please take note!</b>  This function really represents the
"old" way of doing things, and it doesn't fit in well with the client/server 
paradigm.  Please consider it "deprecated" because it may be removed someday.</p>
  
<p>The "doorway" feature is just a generic way to add features to
the system. I called it "Doorway" to make it resemble the doors on non-Unix
boards, but as we all know, us Unix types don't have to write special code
to access the modem. :-)  Anyway, when a user hits the <tt><b>*</b></tt>
(doorway) command, Citadel does...</p>
  
<pre>
USERNAME=(username); export USERNAME
./subsystem (user-number) (screen-width) (access level)
</pre>
  
<p>...so you can put whatever you want in there.  I suggest putting
in a menu program to allow the users to pick one of a number of programs,
etc.  Do be aware that door programs will only be available when the client
and server programs are running on the <i>same</i> computer, and when the
user is running the text-mode client.  Because of these restrictions, Door
programs are being utilized less and less every day.</p>
  
<h3>Troubleshooting and getting help</h3>
  
<p>That's just about all the information you need to install the
system.  But if you get stuck, you can visit UNCENSORED! BBS and report a
problem or ask for help.  But if you intend to report a problem getting the
Citadel server to run, <i>please</i> double-check the following things first: 
</p>
<ul>
 <li>Did you do <tt>./configure &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; make install</tt>
 ?? </li>
  <li>Did you run setup? </li>
  <li>Did you start the server? </li>
</ul>
  
<p>To report a problem, you can log on to UNCENSORED! or any other
BBS on the Citadel network which carries the <tt>Citadel/UX&gt;</tt> room.
 Please DO NOT e-mail the developers directly.  Post a request for help on
the BBS, with all of the following information: </p>
<ul>
 <li>The exact nature of your difficulty </li>
  <li>A transcript of the error message(s) if possible </li>
  <li>The version of Citadel you are running </li>
  <li>The version of Berkeley DB present on your system </li>
  <li>Which operating system you are running, and what version </li>
  <li>If you are running a Linux system, we need to know which distribution,
and the version of the kernel, libc, and pthreads you are using (it would
help to post the output of a <tt>ldd ./citserver</tt> command). </li>
</ul>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>Citadel/UX, when installed properly, will do most of its maintenance by
itself.  It is intended to be run unattended for extended periods of time, and
most installations do just that without any software failures.</p>

<p>The system has seven access levels.  Most users are at the bottom and have
no special privileges. Aides are selected people who have special access within
the Citadel program.  Room Aides only have this access in a certain room. 
Preferred users can be selected by Aides for access to preferred only rooms.  A
sysop is anyone who has access to the various sysop utilities - these are in
their own executable files, which should have their permissions set to allow
only sysops to run them.  You should either create a sysops group in
/etc/group, or use some other existing group for this purpose.</p>
   
<p>Aides have access to EVERY room on the system, public and private (all
types). They also have access to commands starting with
<TT>.<b>A</b>ide</TT> in addition
to being able to delete and move messages.  The system room,
<tt>Aide&gt;</tt>, is accessible only by those users designated as Aides.</p>
  
<h3>Aide commands</h3> 
   
<p>Aides have the following commands available to them that are not available
to normal users. They are:</p>

If you are on a large public or semi-public network of Citadel nodes and you
find content from certain systems or individuals objectionable, you can use
this command to define a rule set to automatically reject those messages when
they arrive on your system.
</TD></TR>

<TR><TD WIDTH=30%><TT>
.<b>A</b>ide <b>T</b>erminate server <b>N</b>ow
</TT></TD><TD>
Immediately shut down the Citadel service, disconnecting any users who are
logged in.  Please keep in mind that it will start right back up again if you
are running the service from <tt>/etc/inittab</tt>, so in practice this command
will probably not get much use.
</TD></TR>

<TR><TD WIDTH=30%><TT>

a digest may contain more than one message.  Each room may have any combination
of List and Digest recipients.

<h3>Editing rooms</h3>
  
<P>This command allows any aide to change the parameters of a room.  Go to
the room you wish to edit and enter the
<TT><B>.A</B>ide <B>E</b>dit room</TT> command.  A series of prompts will
be displayed.  The existing parameters will be displayed in brackets; simply
press return if you want to leave any or all of them unchanged.</P>

<PRE> 
Room name [IG's Fun Room]:
</PRE>
 
<P>...the name of the room.</P>

<PRE>
Private room [Yes]? 
</PRE>
 
<P>...enter Yes if you wish to restrict access to the room, or no if the room
is to be accessible by all users.  Note that Citadel doesn't bother users
about access to rooms every time they need to access the room.  Once a user
gains access to a private room, it then behaves like a public room to them.
The following four questions will only be asked if you selected Private...</p>

<PRE>
Accessible by guessing room name [No]?
</PRE>
 
<P>...if you enter Yes, the room will not show up in users'
<TT><B>K</B>nown rooms</TT>
listing, but if they
<TT><B>.G</B>oto</TT> the room (typing the room's full name), they
will gain access to the room.</p>

<PRE>
Accessible by entering a password [No]?
Room password [mypasswd]:  
</PRE>
 
<P>...this adds an additional layer of security to the room, prompting users
for a password before they can gain access to the room.</P>
 
<P>If you did not select guessname or passworded, then the only way users can
access the room is if an Aide explicitly invites them to the room using the
<TT><B>.A</B>ide <B>R</B>oom <B>I</B>nvite user</TT> command.</P>

<PRE>
Cause current users to forget room [No] ? No
</PRE>
 
<P>Enter Yes if you wish to kick out anyone who currently has access to
the room.</P>

<PRE>
Preferred users only [No]? No
</PRE>
 
<P>Enter Yes if you wish to restrict the room to only users who have level 5
(Preferred User) status (and Aides too, of course).  You should make the room
public if you intend to do this, otherwise the two restrictions will be
COMBINED.</P>
 
<PRE>
Read-only room [No]? No
</PRE>
 
<P>If you set a room to Read-Only, then normal users will not be allowed to
post messages in it.  Messages may only be posted by Aides, and by utility
programs such as the networker and the "aidepost" utility.  This is useful
in situations where a room is used exclusively for important announcements,
or if you've set up a room to receive an Internet mailing list and posting
wouldn't make sense.  Other uses will, of course, become apparent as the
need arises.</P>

<P>Now for a few other attributes...</P>

<PRE>
Directory room [Yes]? Yes
</PRE>
 
<P>...enter Yes if you wish to associate a directory with this room.  This can
be used as a small file repository for files relevant to the topic of the room.
If you
enter Yes, you will also be prompted with the following four questions:</p>

<PRE>
Directory name [mydirname]: 
</PRE>
 
<P>...the name of the subdirectory to put this room's files in.  The name of
the directory created will be
<TT><I>&lt;your BBS directory&gt;</i>/files/<I>&lt;room dir
name&gt;</i></tt>.</p>
    
<PRE>
Uploading allowed [Yes]? Yes
</PRE>
 
<P>...enter Yes if users are allowed to upload to this room.</P>

<PRE>
Downloading allowed [Yes]? Yes
</PRE>
  
<P>...enter Yes if users are allowed to download from this room.</P>

<PRE>
Visible directory [Yes]? Yes
</PRE>
  
<P>...enter Yes if users can read the directory of this room.</P>

<PRE>
Network shared room [No]? No
</PRE>
  
<P>...you can share a room over a network without setting this flag, and
vice versa, but what this flag does is twofold:
<UL>
<LI>It prevents people with no network access from entering messages here
<LI>Messages are displayed with the name of their originating system in
the header.
</UL></P>

<PRE>
Permanent room [No]? No
</PRE>
 
<P>Citadel contains an 'auto purger' which is capable of removing rooms which
have not been posted in for a pre-defined period of time (by default this is
set to two weeks).  If you wish to keep this from happening to a particular
room, you can set this option.  (Keep in mind that
<tt>Lobby&gt;</tt>,
<tt>Aide&gt;</tt>,
any private mailbox rooms, any network shared rooms, and any rooms with a
file directory are automatically permanent.)</P>

<PRE>
Anonymous messages [No]? No
Ask users whether to make messages anonymous [No]? No
</PRE>
  
<P>...you can have rooms in which all messages are automatically anonymous,
and you can have rooms in which users are prompted whether to make a message
anonymous when they enter it.  The real identity of the author of each
message is still revealed to the Room Aide for this room, as well as any
system-wide Aides.</P>

<PRE>
Room aide [Joe Responsible]: 
</PRE>
 
<P>...on larger systems, it helps to designate a person to be responsible for
a room.  Room Aides have access to a restricted set of Aide commands, ONLY
when they are in the room in which they have this privilege.  They can edit
the room, delete the room, delete and move messages, and invite or kick out
users (if it is a private room), but they cannot perform aide commands that
are not room-related (such as changing users access levels).</P>

<PRE>
Listing order [64]: 
</PRE>

<P>This is just a simple way to try to control the order rooms are listed in
when users call up a <TT><B>K</B>nown Rooms</tt> listing.  Rooms with a lower
listing order are displayed prior to rooms with a higher listing order.  It
has no other effect.  For users who list rooms in floor order, the display
will sort first by floor, then by listing order.</p>

<PRE>
Message expire policy (? for list) [0]:
</PRE>

<P>This provides you with the opportunity to select how long each message will
remain in a room before automatically being deleted.  Press <tt><b>?</b></tt>
for a list of options.  You can choose to keep messages around forever (or
until they are manually deleted), until they become a certain number of days
old, or until a certain number of additional messages are posted in the room,
at which time the oldest ones will scroll out.</P>

<P>You will notice that you can also fall back to the default expire policy for
the floor upon which the room resides.  This is the default setting.  You can
change the floor's default with the
<TT><b>;A</b>ide <b>E</b>dit floor</tt> command.  The default setting for
the floor default, in turn, is the system default setting, which can be
changed using the
<tt><b>.A</b>ide <B>S</b>ystem configuration <b>G</b>eneral</tt> command.</p>

<PRE>
Save changes (y/n)? Yes
</PRE>

<P>...this gives you an opportunity to back out, if you feel you really
messed things up while editing.</p>

<h3>File directories</h3>
 
<p>If you have created any directory rooms, you can attach file descriptions to
the filenames through a special file called <tt>filedir</tt>. Each line contains
the name of a file in the directory, followed by a space and then a description
of the file, such as:</p>
 
<PRE>
myfile.txt This is a description of my file.
phluff A phile phull of phluff!
</pre>
 
<P>...this would create file descriptions for the files <tt>myfile.txt</tt>
and <TT>phluff</tt>
which would be displayed along with the directory.  It should also be noted
that when users upload files to your system, they will be prompted for file
descriptions, which will be added to the <tt>filedir</tt> file.  If one does
not exist, it will be created.</p>

<h3>Creating and editing user accounts</h3> 
 
   This command allows any aide to change certain parameters of any user's
account. Entering this command will ask for the name of a user to edit, and
then prompt with the user's current access level, then ask for the new one.
  0 - Marked for deletion
  1 - New unvalidated user
  2 - Problem user
  3 - User with no network privileges
  4 - Normal user
  5 - Preferred user
  6 - Aide
   
   DELETING AND MOVING MESSAGES
   
   Aides have the ability to delete and move messages; however, they must have
message prompting turned on in order to do this. After each message, the
normal prompt appears:
   <A>gain, <N>ext message, <S>top ->
  Entering <D> will delete the message. A (y/n) prompt will appear to confirm
that you really want to delete the message.
  Entering <M> will prompt for a room to move the message to.
     
   
   SYSOP UTILITIES
   
   There are a number of utilities which may be accessed from the shell. It
is up to the system operator to decide which should be "sysop" utilities and
which should be accessible to all shell users. Please see utils.doc for a
description of these programs.
    
   
   CUSTOMIZING THE HELP FILES
 
   The subdirectory called "help" contains your system's help files.  There's
nothing hard-coded into the system that dictates what files should be there.
Whenever a user types the command "<.H>elp" followed by the name of a help
file, it displays the contents of that help file.
 
   The help files that come with the system, of course, are enough to guide
a user through its operation.  But you can add, change, or remove help files
to suit whatever is appropriate for your system. 
 
   Now for the fun part.  There are several strings that you can put in help
files that will be automatically substituted with other strings.  They are:
 
 ^nodename    = The node name of your system on a Citadel/UX network
 ^humannode   = Human-readable node name (also your node name on C86Net)
 ^fqdn        = Your system's fully-qualified domain name
 ^username    = The name of the user reading the help file
 ^usernum     = The user number of the user reading the help file
 ^sysadm      = The name of the system administraor (i.e., you)
 ^variantname = The name of the BBS software you're running
 ^bbsdir      = The directory on the host system in which you have
                installed the Citadel system.
 
   So, for example, you could create a help file which looked like:
 
  "Lots of help, of course, is available right here on ^humannode.  Of
course, if you still have trouble, you could always bug ^sysadm about it!"
