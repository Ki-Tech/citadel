echo This script has been tested with autoconf 2.52, libtool 1.4.2, and
echo automake 1.5. Other versions of automake will probably work, but I
echo recommend the latest compatible versions of autoconf and libtool.

echo Some versions of libtool may have outputted, above, a spurious warning
echo that you have to regenerate your aclocal.m4. This is a mostly harmless bug
echo and can be ignored.
