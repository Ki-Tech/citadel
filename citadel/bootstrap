echo This script has been tested with autoconf 2.53, libtool 1.4d, and
echo automake 1.5. Other versions may work, but I recommend the latest
echo compatible versions of these.
echo
echo libtool 1.4.2 is not sufficient to build portable configure scripts;
echo at least version 1.4d from alpha.gnu.org is needed.
echo
echo Also note that autoconf, automake, and libtool should all be configured
echo with the same prefix.
