Citadel Database Cleanup
---------------------------

This script exports, deletes, and re-imports your database.  If you have
any data corruption issues, this program may be able to clean them up for you.
 
Please note that this program does a Berkeley DB dump/load, not a Citadel
export.  The export files are not generated by the Citadel export module.

WARNING #1:
  MAKE A BACKUP OF YOUR DATA BEFORE ATTEMPTING THIS.  There is no guarantee
  that this will work!

WARNING #2:
  citserver must NOT be running while you do this.

WARNING #3:
  Please try "db_recover -c" from the data/ directory first.  Use this tool
  only if that one fails to fix your problem.
