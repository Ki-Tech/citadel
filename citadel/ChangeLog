Mon Sep 14 20:49:08 EDT 1998 Art Cancro <ajc@uncnsrd.mt-kisco.ny.us>
	* Tried my hand at adding the ability for server extensions to
	  register various types of "hooks" in addition to just adding
	  server commands.  This is probably not final.

Tue Sep  8 12:11:56 EDT 1998 Brian Costello <btx@calyx.net>
	* Added support for dynamic server modules.  Reworked serv_chat.c
	  to be such a module.

Tue Sep  1 23:09:50 EDT 1998 Art Cancro <ajc@uncnsrd.mt-kisco.ny.us>
	* userpurge.c: rewrote using functions from the server core, rather
	  than the now-defunct external API.  This'll be ready once the module
	  loading code is done.  (I just had to commit _something_ tonight.)

Mon Aug 31 22:47:58 EDT 1998 Art Cancro <ajc@uncnsrd.mt-kisco.ny.us>
	* Yanked the citadelapi.c module.  This wasn't working out well.
	* techdocs/citadelapi.txt - began documenting the new API to be used
	  by modules which will be dynamic linked into the server - most of
	  this API is existing server functions.
	* Added a ForEachUser() function with callback mechanism, and reworked
	  cmd_list() to use it.

Sun Aug 30 21:52:43 EDT 1998 Art Cancro <ajc@uncnsrd.mt-kisco.ny.us>
	* Moved all of the gdbm databases to a separate "data" directory.

1998-08-26 Nathan Bryant <bryant@cs.usm.maine.edu>
	* Makefile.in: realclean removes Makefile, fixed `touch citadel.h'
	  problem

1998-08-25 Nathan Bryant <bryant@cs.usm.maine.edu>
	* room_ops.c: include time.h
	* userlist.c, whobbs.c, serv_chat.c, user_ops.c, sysdep.c, stats.c,
	  citadel_decls.h, commands.c, messages.h, routines.h, routines2.h:
	  remove duplicated declarations

Mon Aug 24 23:45:01 EDT 1998 Art Cancro <ajc@uncnsrd.mt-kisco.ny.us>
	* setup.c: Removed yesno_s()
	* citadel.h, room_ops.c: added QRmtime field to struct quickroom,
	  modified whenever a room is modified or posted in.
	* citadelapi.c: Added CtdlForEachRoom() function

Mon Aug 24 20:04:04 EDT 1998 Nathan Bryant <bryant@cs.usm.maine.edu>
        * Makefile.in: new target `cleaner' does the same as `realclean' 
          without removing sysdep.h
	* proto.h: is bad. eliminate. I've moved the prototypes into several
	  header files, one per .c file

Mon Aug 24 00:45:55 EDT 1998 Art Cancro <ajc@uncnsrd.mt-kisco.ny.us>
	* Added a CtdlGotoRoom() function to the CitadelAPI.
 
Sun Aug 23 21:47:00 EDT 1998 Art Cancro <ajc@uncnsrd.mt-kisco.ny.us>
	* sysoputil is finally dead!  Removed it from the build.
	* Added userpurge.c server extension (initial implementation)

Tue Aug 18 00:42:33 EDT 1998 Nathan Bryant <bryant@cs.usm.maine.edu>
	* Makefile.in: `clean' target no longer rm's sysdep.h; new target
	  `realclean' removes everything clean does, plus sysdep.h, plus
	  target binaries.
	* Configure: add -Wstrict-prototypes to CFLAGS for gcc systems
	* *.[ch]: protoized. Added several new header files containing
	  prototypes and other external declarations; many duplicated
	  declarations still should be moved to header files. proto.h must die
	  as well, IMHO.

Mon Aug 17 23:52:13 EDT 1998 Art Cancro <ajc@uncnsrd.mt-kisco.ny.us>
	* Implemented a bunch of user account related functions in the
	  CitadelAPI library.

Mon Aug 17 20:01:18 EDT 1998 Art Cancro <ajc@uncnsrd.mt-kisco.ny.us>
	* Fixed the crash problem.  It wasn't AGUP/ASUP, but rather a buffer
	  overrun in getuser() (thanks, Nathan).  Implemented overrun checks
	  in getuser(), getroom(), and getfloor() to prevent future problems.

Mon Aug 17 00:06:52 EDT 1998 Art Cancro <ajc@uncnsrd.mt-kisco.ny.us>
	* Updated citmail.c with the latest stuff from the production system.
	* Implemented AGUP and ASUP commands, but AGUP crashes the server
	  after its first successful use (user-not-found's don't affect it).

Thu Aug  6 19:25:01 EDT 1998 Art Cancro <ajc@uncnsrd.mt-kisco.ny.us>
	* Got the CitadelAPI library to the point where the server can start
	  up an extension, and the extension will connect to the server, do
	  some initialization, call a user-supplied CtdlMain(), and exit.  Also
	  hacked together a _temporary_ form of the new EXTN server command.
 
Wed Aug  5 23:02:22 EDT 1998 Art Cancro <ajc@uncnsrd.mt-kisco.ny.us>
	* Second attempt at getting the server API started.  Now it runs
	  outside of the server and builds a connection.

Tue Aug  4 18:33:06 EDT 1998 Art Cancro <ajc@uncnsrd.mt-kisco.ny.us>
	* Modified the appearance of Internet addresses when they arrive on
	  a Citadel system.
	* Removed the <E> field from the message format writeup in hack.txt.
	* Fixed-up citmail.c so that it doesn't try to do database lookups.

Mon Aug  3 23:01:37 EDT 1998 Art Cancro <ajc@uncnsrd.mt-kisco.ny.us>
	* Started developing the server-side API.  This is in its very
	  initial stages.  See serverapi.c and techdoc/api.txt

1998-08-02  Nathan Bryant  <bryant@cs.usm.maine.edu>
	* Makefile.in: added config_decls.h to dependencies

Sun Aug  2 21:09:09 EDT 1998 Nathan Bryant <bryant@cs.usm.maine.edu>
	* config_defs.h: renamed to config_decls.h
	* config.c, sysoputil.c: updated to reflect the above

Sun Aug  2 18:52:05 EDT 1998 Nathan Bryant <bryant@cs.usm.maine.edu>
	* config_defs.h: new file, contains external declarations from config.c
	* config.c: moved defs to config_defs.h, use PATH_MAX from <limits.h>
	  for bbs_home_directory
	* mailinglist.c, support.c: include <string.h>
	* sysoputil.c: include <string.h>, <limits.h>, "config_defs.h", remove
	  duplicated defs, replace gets() call with fgets()
	* user_ops.c: define _XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED

Sat Aug  1 18:32:52 EDT 1998 Nathan Bryant <bryant@cs.usm.maine.edu>
	* ipc_c_tcp.c: fixed order of memcpy parameters after gethostbyname

Sun Jul 19 17:26:12 EDT 1998 Nathan Bryant <bryant@cs.usm.maine.edu>
	* ChangeLog: reordered; the GNU standard is to add new entries to the
	  top.
	* .cvsignore: added userlist

Sun Jul 12 20:58:59 EDT 1998 Art Cancro <ajc@uncnsrd.mt-kisco.ny.us>
        * Finished migrating everything to the new data store.
        * Replaced the binary "calllog" with the ASCII "citadel.log"
        * Began converting broken utilities that depend on the old data store

Sat Jul 11 00:20:48 EDT 1998 Nathan Bryant <bryant@cs.usm.maine.edu>
	* Makefile.in: removed msgstats

Fri Jul 10 1998 Art Cancro <ajc@uncnsrd.mt-kisco.ny.us>
	* Initial CVS import
