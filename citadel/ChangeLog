Mon Aug 24 00:45:55 EDT 1998 Art Cancro <ajc@uncnsrd.mt-kisco.ny.us>
	* Added a CtdlGotoRoom() function to the CitadelAPI.
 
Sun Aug 23 21:47:00 EDT 1998 Art Cancro <ajc@uncnsrd.mt-kisco.ny.us>
	* sysoputil is finally dead!  Removed it from the build.
	* Added userpurge.c server extension (initial implementation)

Tue Aug 18 00:42:33 EDT 1998 Nathan Bryant <bryant@cs.usm.maine.edu>
	* Makefile.in: `clean' target no longer rm's sysdep.h; new target
	  `realclean' removes everything clean does, plus sysdep.h, plus
	  target binaries.
	* Configure: add -Wstrict-prototypes to CFLAGS for gcc systems
	* *.[ch]: protoized. Added several new header files containing
	  prototypes and other external declarations; many duplicated
	  declarations still should be moved to header files. proto.h must die
	  as well, IMHO.

Mon Aug 17 23:52:13 EDT 1998 Art Cancro <ajc@uncnsrd.mt-kisco.ny.us>
	* Implemented a bunch of user account related functions in the
	  CitadelAPI library.

Mon Aug 17 20:01:18 EDT 1998 Art Cancro <ajc@uncnsrd.mt-kisco.ny.us>
	* Fixed the crash problem.  It wasn't AGUP/ASUP, but rather a buffer
	  overrun in getuser() (thanks, Nathan).  Implemented overrun checks
	  in getuser(), getroom(), and getfloor() to prevent future problems.

Mon Aug 17 00:06:52 EDT 1998 Art Cancro <ajc@uncnsrd.mt-kisco.ny.us>
	* Updated citmail.c with the latest stuff from the production system.
	* Implemented AGUP and ASUP commands, but AGUP crashes the server
	  after its first successful use (user-not-found's don't affect it).

Thu Aug  6 19:25:01 EDT 1998 Art Cancro <ajc@uncnsrd.mt-kisco.ny.us>
	* Got the CitadelAPI library to the point where the server can start
	  up an extension, and the extension will connect to the server, do
	  some initialization, call a user-supplied CtdlMain(), and exit.  Also
	  hacked together a _temporary_ form of the new EXTN server command.
 
Wed Aug  5 23:02:22 EDT 1998 Art Cancro <ajc@uncnsrd.mt-kisco.ny.us>
	* Second attempt at getting the server API started.  Now it runs
	  outside of the server and builds a connection.

Tue Aug  4 18:33:06 EDT 1998 Art Cancro <ajc@uncnsrd.mt-kisco.ny.us>
	* Modified the appearance of Internet addresses when they arrive on
	  a Citadel system.
	* Removed the <E> field from the message format writeup in hack.txt.
	* Fixed-up citmail.c so that it doesn't try to do database lookups.

Mon Aug  3 23:01:37 EDT 1998 Art Cancro <ajc@uncnsrd.mt-kisco.ny.us>
	* Started developing the server-side API.  This is in its very
	  initial stages.  See serverapi.c and techdoc/api.txt

1998-08-02  Nathan Bryant  <bryant@cs.usm.maine.edu>
	* Makefile.in: added config_decls.h to dependencies

Sun Aug  2 21:09:09 EDT 1998 Nathan Bryant <bryant@cs.usm.maine.edu>
	* config_defs.h: renamed to config_decls.h
	* config.c, sysoputil.c: updated to reflect the above

Sun Aug  2 18:52:05 EDT 1998 Nathan Bryant <bryant@cs.usm.maine.edu>
	* config_defs.h: new file, contains external declarations from config.c
	* config.c: moved defs to config_defs.h, use PATH_MAX from <limits.h>
	  for bbs_home_directory
	* mailinglist.c, support.c: include <string.h>
	* sysoputil.c: include <string.h>, <limits.h>, "config_defs.h", remove
	  duplicated defs, replace gets() call with fgets()
	* user_ops.c: define _XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED

Sat Aug  1 18:32:52 EDT 1998 Nathan Bryant <bryant@cs.usm.maine.edu>
	* ipc_c_tcp.c: fixed order of memcpy parameters after gethostbyname

Sun Jul 19 17:26:12 EDT 1998 Nathan Bryant <bryant@cs.usm.maine.edu>
	* ChangeLog: reordered; the GNU standard is to add new entries to the
	  top.
	* .cvsignore: added userlist

Sun Jul 12 20:58:59 EDT 1998 Art Cancro <ajc@uncnsrd.mt-kisco.ny.us>
        * Finished migrating everything to the new data store.
        * Replaced the binary "calllog" with the ASCII "citadel.log"
        * Began converting broken utilities that depend on the old data store

Sat Jul 11 00:20:48 EDT 1998 Nathan Bryant <bryant@cs.usm.maine.edu>
	* Makefile.in: removed msgstats

Fri Jul 10 1998 Art Cancro <ajc@uncnsrd.mt-kisco.ny.us>
	* Initial CVS import
