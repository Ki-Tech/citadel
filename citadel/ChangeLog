	* sysdep.c: read citadel.config _before_ initializing loadable modules
	* stats.c: fixed segfault resulting from extracting log lines
	* Ripped most of the "attachments" stuff out of both the client and
	  server.  (Thought of a better way to handle it ... LATER.)

1998-12-03 Nathan Bryant <bryant@cs.usm.maine.edu>
	* setup.c: create citadel.config with mode 0600
	* Makefile.in: don't chmod sendcommand

	  and install-doc subtargets

Sat Nov 21 16:53:30 EST 1998 Art Cancro <ajc@uncnsrd.mt-kisco.ny.us>
	* Added a fourth color mode in the client: "user" which turns color
	  on or off according to a per-user flag stored on the server.  Added
	  server-side support for this too, of course.
	* import.c: removed
	* serv_expire.c: finished the code to purge stale visits
	* sysdep.c: strip trailing nonprintables in client_gets()
	* routines2.c: fixed <.AS> command; all configs now work properly

	  client in order to simplify the setup procedure

Thu Nov 19 23:28:33 EST 1998 Art Cancro <ajc@uncnsrd.mt-kisco.ny.us>
	* Fixed serv_upgrade.c and export5.c (found elsewhere) to use a new
	  export format which treats visits as a separate section
	* serv_expire.c: began writing functions to purge rooms and visits
	  (neither work yet), and added a way to call defrag_databases()

Wed Nov 18 23:51:17 EST 1998 Art Cancro <ajc@uncnsrd.mt-kisco.ny.us>
	* Reimplemented 'visit' structs stored globally instead of as
	  lists-per-user

Tue Nov 17 22:37:48 EST 1998 Art Cancro <ajc@uncnsrd.mt-kisco.ny.us>
	* Started implementing global room numbers.

Sun Nov 15 20:32:34 EST 1998 Art Cancro <ajc@uncnsrd.mt-kisco.ny.us>
	* room_ops.c: mailbox rooms always appear on the main floor
	* made QR_MAILBOX rooms non-editable
	* cmd_setr() delete old room record when room name changes

	* Rewrote cmd_rchg() and also increased the size of the "fakename"
	  buffer.  Overruns are probably what was causing the crashes.
	* Changed the way cmd_ent3() handles mail messages; the previous code
	  rerouted all private mail to the trash.

Wed Nov 11 17:57:39 EST 1998 Art Cancro <ajc@uncnsrd.mt-kisco.ny.us>
	* citserver.c: slight changes to cmd_rchg() and cmd_hchg() [crashes]
	* citserver.c, msgbase.c, user_ops.c: hide the owner-prefix of mail
	  rooms in a couple more places: set_wtmpsupp() and make_message()
	* sysdep.c: added an fflush() to lprintf() for "tail -f"-able logs
	* serv_expire.c: purge ops are now a command instead of a cleanup
	  function.  This is probably temporary as well.
	* citadel.c: fixed the way <.WL> parses the returned data from a
	  TIME command.

1998-11-11 Nathan Bryant <bryant@cs.usm.maine.edu>
	* serv_upgrade.c: fix uninitialized variable

Wed Nov 11 00:47:32 EST 1998 Art Cancro <ajc@uncnsrd.mt-kisco.ny.us>
	* msgbase.c: fixed a bug that was misrouting incoming network msgs
	* server.h, database.c: wrapped all GDBM calls in critical sections
	  to avoid making those calls re-entrantly (gdbm fatal: lseek error)

1998-11-10 Nathan Bryant <bryant@cs.usm.maine.edu>
	* Makefile.in: link in snprintf.o where needed

	* serv_expire.c: created; moved message expiry from serv_test.c,
	  moved user purge from userpurge.c
	* userpurge.c: deleted
	* routines2.c: finished <.AS> command
	* room_ops.c: fixed Aide room access (for some reason, the Aide
	  room had the QR_MAILBOX flag set)

1998-11-08 Nathan Bryant <bryant@cs.usm.maine.edu>
	* useradmin.c: really removed (cvs remove)
	* aidepost.c, citadel.c: convert all sprintf() calls to snprintf()
	* sysdep.c: fix overrun in lprintf() described by dme/Dead Monkey
	* citmail.c, citserver.c: convert all sprintf() call to snprintf()

Sun Nov  8 13:19:36 EST 1998 Art Cancro <ajc@uncnsrd.mt-kisco.ny.us>
	* useradmin.c: removed
	* utils.doc: removed references to useradmin and sysoputil

	* messages.c: temporarily set screenwidth to a fixed value of 80
	  during <P>rint operations.

Mon Nov  2 12:59:03 EST 1998 Art Cancro <ajc@uncnsrd.mt-kisco.ny.us>
	* setup.c: looks for 'citadel', 'bbs', or 'guest' in /etc/passwd to
	  try to get a default for bbsuid if it's currently set to 0
	* citmail.c: changed usersupp.eternal to usersupp.usernum (why didn't
	  it complain about this before?)
	* serv_upgrade.c: began writing an "export" command to do sidegrades

Sun Nov  1 18:47:42 EST 1998 Art Cancro <ajc@uncnsrd.mt-kisco.ny.us>
	* serv_upgrade.c: cosmetic changes
	* Implemented message expiry by date (this really needs to be moved
	  out of serv_test.c, but where does it belong?)

1998-11-01 Nathan Bryant <bryant@cs.usm.maine.edu>
	* serv_upgrade.c: warning fixes
	* acconfig.h: remove ANSI_COLOR
	* Configure, Makefile.tmpl: removed

	* More stoopid ANSI colour additions here and there.
	* ANSI colour selection is now in citadel.rc instead of an option in
	  the configure script.  "on" "off" and "auto" are available.
	* added "build.txt" to the techdoc directory, with LS's build notes

1998-10-31 Nathan Bryant <bryant@cs.usm.maine.edu>
	* citadel.c, commands.c, commands.h: set background color to black
	  before clearing screen, so that we can actually see text on
	  black-on-white xterms.

1998-10-29 Nathan Bryant <bryant@cs.usm.maine.edu>
	* rooms.c: fix color of Mail>
	* citadel.c: send ANSI detect sequence after attach_to_server() so the
	  terminal doesn't send the answerback sequence to the shell if we
	  can't connect.

Wed Oct 28 20:20:14 EST 1998 Art Cancro <ajc@uncnsrd.mt-kisco.ny.us
	* citadel.c: Added a splash of colour to the Wholist

	* aclocal.m4, missing: new files, also swiped from automake
	* citadel.c: don't mung the terminal if we can't find citadel.rc
	* Makefile.in: added `install' target, `clean' removes
	  *.mo, rebuild configure when configure.in changes.
	* configure.in: check for install and autoconf
	* configure.in, Makefile.in: only pass -fPIC to gcc
	* policy.c: warning fix for OSF/1 (use memset() instead of bzero())

Tue Oct 27 22:25:42 EST 1998 Art Cancro <ajc@uncnsrd.mt-kisco.ny.us>
	* Unified the "unpacked database" format for both upgrades and
	  sidegrades (also see export5.c elsewhere)
	* citserver.c: clear out cmdbuf before reading a command; some server
	  commands were accidentally extracting parameters from previous cmds
	* rooms.c: removed the warning about the ineffectiveness of kicking
	  users out of public rooms, because the new server can do lockouts

1998-10-27 Nathan Bryant <bryant@cs.usm.maine.edu>
	* sysdep.c (client_gets), ipc_c_tcp.c (serv_gets): improved handling
	  of long lines. 
	* Makefile.in: partial support for VPATH builds, autodependency fix

Tue Oct 27 00:08:16 EST 1998 Art Cancro <ajc@uncnsrd.mt-kisco.ny.us>
	* minor documentation changes

Sun Oct 25 14:57:40 EST 1998 Art Cancro <ajc@uncnsrd.mt-kisco.ny.us>

	* Client: added <.A>ide <S>ystem configuration command

1998-10-24 Nathan Bryant <bryant@cs.usm.maine.edu>
	* Makefile.in: Auto dependency generation (may require GNU make, but
	  does at least function without this feature on OSF/1 make);
	  Makefile is regenerated when Makefile.in changes (ditto);
	  `realclean' is now known as `distclean';
	  portability fixes for older Unix make utilities
	* citadel.c, citadel.h, commands.c: make client suspendable

	  the user has prompting turned off (citadel.rc option)

1998-10-16 Nathan Bryant <bryant@cs.usm.maine.edu>
	* sysdep.c (cprintf): generate a newline on truncated buffer
	* room_ops.c: exploitable overrun fixes

Thu Oct 15 19:27:32 EDT 1998 Art Cancro <ajc@uncnsrd.mt-kisco.ny.us>
	* msgbase.c: reimplemented cmd_move()
	  room_ops.c: wrote AddMessageToRoom() which is used for both entering
	  and moving messages.
	* setup.c: system-default message expire policy of "number of
	  messages, 150" is now a default configuration instead of a temp hack
	* proxy.c: cache dir create now dies on any error except EEXIST

Wed Oct 14 22:41:16 EDT 1998 Art Cancro <ajc@uncnsrd.mt-kisco.ny.us>

	* Removed most of the "level 9" trace messages no longer needed

1998-10-12 Nathan Bryant <bryant@cs.usm.maine.edu>
	* Makefile.in: simplified to use pattern rules; files compiled with
	  -D_REENTRANT go to *.ro to allow the same files to be used with both
	  client and server
	* tools.c, tools.h: new files; misc routines used by both client and
	  server go here. contains safestrncpy() at the moment.
	* rooms.c: fix several exploitable buffer overruns
	* sysdep.c: fix infinite loop when long lines are received from the
	  client; fix exploitable buffer overrun in cprintf()

1998-10-11 Nathan Bryant <bryant@cs.usm.maine.edu>
	* citserver.c: fix two more overruns, one of which was preventing

Fri Oct  9 18:34:06 EDT 1998 Art Cancro <ajc@uncnsrd.mt-kisco.ny.us>
	* user_ops.c: added PurgeStaleRelationships() to do processing at
	  session logout time to remove visits for rooms which no longer exist
	* user_ops.c: implemented NewMailCount()

1998-10-09 Nathan Bryant <bryant@cs.usm.maine.edu>
	* serv_chat.c: fix buffer overrun that was resulting in segv's
	* serv_chat.c: fix another overrun that could cause sessions to hang,
	  and cleaned up some other strncpy()-related stuff. DON'T FORGET TO
	  NULL-TERMINATE DESTINATION BUFFERS AFTER STRNCPY CALLS.

Fri Oct  9 13:22:37 EDT 1998 Art Cancro <ajc@uncnsrd.mt-kisco.ny.us>
	* Implemented "lazy mode" traversal - pressing the space bar will do
	  <N>ext messsage, <G>oto next room, or read <N>ew as appropriate.
	* room_ops.c: modify CtdlRoomAccess() to allow access to mailbox rooms
	  only to their owners.

Thu Oct  8 17:13:27 EDT 1998 Art Cancro <ajc@uncnsrd.mt-kisco.ny.us>
	* messages.c, citadel.rc: added the ability to display message numbers
	  in the header when reading messages.  I think this is butt ugly, but
	  some of the DaveCode afficionados seem to like it...

Thu Oct  8 15:34:45 EDT 1998 Art Cancro <ajc@uncnsrd.mt-kisco.ny.us>
	* room_ops.c: Added is_noneditable() function to replace all of the
	  duplicated code present in all functions which edit room parameters.

	  netproc.c, rcit.c, server.h, stats.c, userlist.c: use time_t where
	  needed
	* control.c, room_ops.c, serv_chat.c, sysdep.c: use memset() instead of
	  bzero()
	* dynloader.c, dynloader.h, messages.c, server.h, sysdep.c,
	  sysdep_decls.h: function pointer/prototyping fixes
	* rooms.c: use mkfifo(3) instead of system("mkfifo")

1998-10-07 Nathan Bryant <bryant@cs.usm.maine.edu>
	* snprintf.c, snprintf.h: new files
	* Makefile.in, configure.in, dynloader.c, sysdep.c: support for the
	  above; citserver now builds and runs on Digital Unix 4.0d with the
	  GNU-style configure script. there is a bug with the hostname display
	  in the wholist.
	* netproc.c: sillyness fix
	* room_ops.h: prototype delete_room()
	* client_chat.c, commands.c, serv_chat.c, sysdep.c:
	  use HAVE_SYS_SELECT_H macro

Sun Oct  4 23:35:18 EDT 1998 Art Cancro <ajc@uncnsrd.mt-kisco.ny.us>
	* Did the big migration to the new data structures.  Lots of stuff is
	  now broken.  Basic moving from room to room works, but Mail is
	  broken, and some of the administrative commands are unimplemented.

1998-10-02 Nathan Bryant <bryant@cs.usm.maine.edu>
	* configure.in: autologin now defaults to disabled

Fri Oct  2 00:04:31 EDT 1998 Art Cancro <ajc@uncnsrd.mt-kisco.ny.us>
	* Finally removed all three usersupp.foo[MAXROOMS] elements, and
	  migrated all the code that used them to use "struct visit" instead.

Thu Oct  1 23:02:20 EDT 1998 Art Cancro <ajc@uncnsrd.mt-kisco.ny.us>
	* Rewrote [l][get|put]room() functions to use room names rather than
	  room index numbers.  Temporarily prepended a "n" to these four
	  function names until they are put to use.

Thu Oct  1 16:27:13 EDT 1998 Art Cancro <ajc@uncnsrd.mt-kisco.ny.us>
	* Removed a few more references to usersupp.lastseen[]

1998-10-01 Nathan Bryant <bryant@cs.usm.maine.edu>
	* .cvsignore: add so_locations (generated by osf1 ld with shared libs)
	* Makefile.in: restructured variables for greater consistency, use
	  @echo to print out notices during the make process, add so_locations
	  to `cleaner'
	* configure.in, Makefile.in: configure checks for -rdynamic
	* ipc_c_tcp.c: fix DEC compiler warning wrt unsigned char
	* stats.c: add semicolon to placate DREC compiler
	* user_ops.c: define _POSIX_C_SOURCE, include <limits.h>

	  libpthread[s] on DEC Unix

1998-09-30 Nathan Bryant <bryant@cs.usm.maine.edu>
	* Makefile.in: new variable PTHREAD_DEFS for portability
	* aidepost.c, citadel.c, citmail.c, mailinglist.c, msgform.c,
	  netmailer.c, netpoll.c, netproc.c, rcit.c, readlog.c, setup.c,
	  stats.c, userlist.c, whobbs.c: return type of main() is int
	* citadel.c, commands.c, messages.c: use time_t properly
	* citserver.c: include <limits.h>
	* config.guess, config.sub, install-sh: new files
	* configure.in: don't use gcc on Digital Unix

Tue Sep 29 23:17:34 EDT 1998 Art Cancro <ajc@uncnsrd.mt-kisco.ny.us>
	* room_ops.c: modified usergoto() to look at the new data structures
	  for counting new messages and such.

1998-09-29 Nathan Bryant <bryant@cs.usm.maine.edu>
	* user_ops.c: fix compiler warning and potential memory leak,
	  include sysdep.h
	* configure.in, Makefile.in: only build the server if we find pthreads
	* Makefile.in: realclean removes config.{cache,log,status}

Tue Sep 29 13:20:14 EDT 1998 Art Cancro <ajc@uncnsrd.mt-kisco.ny.us>
	* Removed code from some of the utilities which was still attempting
	  to access the old non-gdbm data store.
	* housekeeping.c: rewrote check_ref_counts() to do a ForEachRoom()
	  traversal instead of a MAXROOMS loop.
	* sysdep.c: set up a dummy CitContext record to be used during server
	  startup, during which time there is no real context.

Mon Sep 28 23:51:51 EDT 1998 Art Cancro <ajc@uncnsrd.mt-kisco.ny.us>
	* Implemented the function ForEachRoom() to handle all-rooms traversal
	  (this will work with both the old and new paradigms, because both
	  use a GDBM database with one room per record).  Migrated all room
	  list commands to use it.

Mon Sep 28 22:05:35 EDT 1998 Art Cancro <ajc@uncnsrd.mt-kisco.ny.us>
	* Implemented the function CtdlRoomAccess() to handle *all* of the
	  user-access-to-rooms functionality.  Migrated all room list commands
	  to use it.  Still need to migrate gotos.

1998-09-28 Nathan Bryant <bryant@cs.usm.maine.edu>
	* configure.in, acconfig.h: new files; partially functional GNU
	  autoconf configure script. Run autoheader; autoconf; ./configure
	  --prefix=`pwd` to test.
	* Makefile.tmpl: new file; this is what Makefile.in used to be. Used by
	  Configure.
	* Makefile.in: modified to work with autoconf-style configure script
	* Configure: modified to use Makefile.tmpl and generate autoconf-style
	  macros. Removed procfs detection. Pass -O2 to gcc, -O to other
	  compilers. Removed mknod/mkfifo detection; code should use mkfifo(3).
	* citmail.c, msgform.c, netproc.c, routines.c, support.c, userlist.c,
	  whobbs.c: use HAVE_STRERROR macro rather than NO_STRERROR
	* commands.c: use HAVE_TERMIOS_H macro rather than POSIX_TERMIO
	* netproc.c: remove procfs stuff. simply attempt to kill the target
	  process with signal zero instead; this checks whether the process
	  exists.
	* setup.c, useradmin.c: use HAVE_CURSES_H macro

Sun Sep 27 23:41:29 EDT 1998 Art Cancro <ajc@uncnsrd.mt-kisco.ny.us>
	* BOTH the old and new generation systems are being written to at
	  this point.  Code that reads stuff is still using the old system.

Sun Sep 27 16:10:49 EDT 1998 Art Cancro <ajc@uncnsrd.mt-kisco.ny.us>
	* Changed all "generation" variables from char to long, in preparation
	  for removing MAXROOMS.  Generations for new rooms are now timestamps.
	* Defined "struct visit" to hold user/room relationships.
	* Removed some #define's from citadel.h that are no longer used.

Wed Sep 23 13:41:49 EDT 1998 Art Cancro <ajc@uncnsrd.mt-kisco.ny.us>
	* More changes to support attachments.  They mostly work, but only
	  in fixed-format messages.

Mon Sep 21 21:19:17 EDT 1998 Art Cancro <ajc@uncnsrd.mt-kisco.ny.us>
	* msgbase.c: began laying the groundwork to support attachments.
	  Purchased Rogaine(tm) in preparation for expected hair loss.

1998-09-21 Nathan Bryant <bryant@cs.usm.maine.edu>
	* msgbase.c: include dynloader.h
	* citadelapi.h: removed
	* dynloader.h: prototype CtdlRegisterUserHook()

Sun Sep 20 18:56:37 EDT 1998 Art Cancro <ajc@uncnsrd.mt-kisco.ny.us>
	* Added a UserFunctionHook category to implement hooks which perform
	  operations on various users or usernames

Fri Sep 18 21:14:41 EDT 1998 Art Cancro <ajc@uncnsrd.mt-kisco.ny.us>
	* citserver.c: removed cmd_extn() and related code

1998-09-18 Nathan Bryant <bryant@cs.usm.maine.edu>
	* user_ops.c: include dynloader.h
	* roomstats.{c,mk}: removed
	* Configure, Makefile.in: autodependency-related fixes

Thu Sep 17 22:55:29 EDT 1998 Art Cancro <ajc@uncnsrd.mt-kisco.ny.us>
	* Various changes to allow "new messages" to work correctly with Mail

Thu Sep 17 22:21:45 EDT 1998 Art Cancro <ajc@uncnsrd.mt-kisco.ny.us>
	* server.h, dynloader.c, citserver.c, user_ops.c: reduced the number
	  of hook types by inventing an EventType field to the Session hook.
	* proxy.c: added pre-fetching

1998-09-17 Nathan Bryant <bryant@cs.usm.maine.edu>
	* Makefile.in: add SERV_MODULES and PROXY_TARGETS to `cleaner'
	* dynloader.[ch], serv_{chat,test}.[ch], sysdep.c: cleaned
	  up the dynamic loader interface as follows:
	  - all the symbol table stuff is gone.
	  - modules are loaded once at server startup and never unloaded.
	  - Added a new function CtdlRegisterProtoHook() to handle the stuff
	    that was being done with the symbol tables.
	  - Dynamic_Module_Init() now returns a pointer to a static struct
	    DLModule_Info; this structure itself has been modified to use char*
	    fields instead of fixed char arrays.
	* roomstats.c: include <stdarg.h> not <stdargs.h> (is this file still
	  in use?)
	* Configure, Makefile.in: added autodependency support

Wed Sep 16 22:25:13 EDT 1998 Art Cancro <ajc@uncnsrd.mt-kisco.ny.us>
	* Implemented separate structs, lists, and functions for each type
	  of server-side hook available.

1998-09-16 Nathan Bryant <bryant@cs.usm.maine.edu>
	* ipc_c_tcp.c: Fixed up some #include/prototyping stuff, call memcpy()
	  instead of bcopy()
	* hooks.h: removed
	* sysdep.c, user_ops.c: removed reference to hooks.h

Wed Sep 16 11:42:42 EDT 1998 Art Cancro <ajc@uncnsrd.mt-kisco.ny.us>
	* ipc_c_tcp.c: Reversed any changes that have been made to this file,
	  because something was causing abominally slow response time.
	* proxy.c: added.  This will eventually become a caching, pre-fetching
	  multiuser proxy server for the Citadel protocol.

1998-09-15 Nathan Bryant <bryant@cs.usm.maine.edu>
	* Makefile.in: remove support.o from serv_chat.so, add -fPIC to compile
	  flags for serv_chat.o
	* dynloader.c: include "sysdep_decls.h", use RTLD_NOW not RTLD_LAZY
	* dynloader.h: prototype CtdlRegisterHook()
	* .cvsignore: added data

Mon Sep 14 20:49:08 EDT 1998 Art Cancro <ajc@uncnsrd.mt-kisco.ny.us>
	* Tried my hand at adding the ability for server extensions to
	  register various types of "hooks" in addition to just adding
	  server commands.  This is probably not final.

Tue Sep  8 12:11:56 EDT 1998 Brian Costello <btx@calyx.net>
	* Added support for dynamic server modules.  Reworked serv_chat.c
	  to be such a module.

Tue Sep  1 23:09:50 EDT 1998 Art Cancro <ajc@uncnsrd.mt-kisco.ny.us>
	* userpurge.c: rewrote using functions from the server core, rather
	  than the now-defunct external API.  This'll be ready once the module
	  loading code is done.  (I just had to commit _something_ tonight.)

Mon Aug 31 22:47:58 EDT 1998 Art Cancro <ajc@uncnsrd.mt-kisco.ny.us>
	* Yanked the citadelapi.c module.  This wasn't working out well.
	* techdocs/citadelapi.txt - began documenting the new API to be used
	  by modules which will be dynamic linked into the server - most of
	  this API is existing server functions.
	* Added a ForEachUser() function with callback mechanism, and reworked
	  cmd_list() to use it.

Sun Aug 30 21:52:43 EDT 1998 Art Cancro <ajc@uncnsrd.mt-kisco.ny.us>
	* Moved all of the gdbm databases to a separate "data" directory.

1998-08-26 Nathan Bryant <bryant@cs.usm.maine.edu>
	* Makefile.in: realclean removes Makefile, fixed `touch citadel.h'
	  problem

1998-08-25 Nathan Bryant <bryant@cs.usm.maine.edu>
	* room_ops.c: include time.h
	* userlist.c, whobbs.c, serv_chat.c, user_ops.c, sysdep.c, stats.c,
	  citadel_decls.h, commands.c, messages.h, routines.h, routines2.h:
	  remove duplicated declarations

Mon Aug 24 23:45:01 EDT 1998 Art Cancro <ajc@uncnsrd.mt-kisco.ny.us>
	* setup.c: Removed yesno_s()
	* citadel.h, room_ops.c: added QRmtime field to struct quickroom,
	  modified whenever a room is modified or posted in.
	* citadelapi.c: Added CtdlForEachRoom() function

Mon Aug 24 20:04:04 EDT 1998 Nathan Bryant <bryant@cs.usm.maine.edu>
        * Makefile.in: new target `cleaner' does the same as `realclean' 
          without removing sysdep.h
	* proto.h: is bad. eliminate. I've moved the prototypes into several
	  header files, one per .c file

Mon Aug 24 00:45:55 EDT 1998 Art Cancro <ajc@uncnsrd.mt-kisco.ny.us>
	* Added a CtdlGotoRoom() function to the CitadelAPI.
 
Sun Aug 23 21:47:00 EDT 1998 Art Cancro <ajc@uncnsrd.mt-kisco.ny.us>
	* sysoputil is finally dead!  Removed it from the build.
	* Added userpurge.c server extension (initial implementation)

Tue Aug 18 00:42:33 EDT 1998 Nathan Bryant <bryant@cs.usm.maine.edu>
	* Makefile.in: `clean' target no longer rm's sysdep.h; new target
	  `realclean' removes everything clean does, plus sysdep.h, plus
	  target binaries.
	* Configure: add -Wstrict-prototypes to CFLAGS for gcc systems
	* *.[ch]: protoized. Added several new header files containing
	  prototypes and other external declarations; many duplicated
	  declarations still should be moved to header files. proto.h must die
	  as well, IMHO.

Mon Aug 17 23:52:13 EDT 1998 Art Cancro <ajc@uncnsrd.mt-kisco.ny.us>
	* Implemented a bunch of user account related functions in the
	  CitadelAPI library.

Mon Aug 17 20:01:18 EDT 1998 Art Cancro <ajc@uncnsrd.mt-kisco.ny.us>
	* Fixed the crash problem.  It wasn't AGUP/ASUP, but rather a buffer
	  overrun in getuser() (thanks, Nathan).  Implemented overrun checks
	  in getuser(), getroom(), and getfloor() to prevent future problems.

Mon Aug 17 00:06:52 EDT 1998 Art Cancro <ajc@uncnsrd.mt-kisco.ny.us>
	* Updated citmail.c with the latest stuff from the production system.
	* Implemented AGUP and ASUP commands, but AGUP crashes the server
	  after its first successful use (user-not-found's don't affect it).

Thu Aug  6 19:25:01 EDT 1998 Art Cancro <ajc@uncnsrd.mt-kisco.ny.us>
	* Got the CitadelAPI library to the point where the server can start
	  up an extension, and the extension will connect to the server, do
	  some initialization, call a user-supplied CtdlMain(), and exit.  Also
	  hacked together a _temporary_ form of the new EXTN server command.
 
Wed Aug  5 23:02:22 EDT 1998 Art Cancro <ajc@uncnsrd.mt-kisco.ny.us>
	* Second attempt at getting the server API started.  Now it runs
	  outside of the server and builds a connection.

Tue Aug  4 18:33:06 EDT 1998 Art Cancro <ajc@uncnsrd.mt-kisco.ny.us>
	* Modified the appearance of Internet addresses when they arrive on
	  a Citadel system.
	* Removed the <E> field from the message format writeup in hack.txt.
	* Fixed-up citmail.c so that it doesn't try to do database lookups.

Mon Aug  3 23:01:37 EDT 1998 Art Cancro <ajc@uncnsrd.mt-kisco.ny.us>
	* Started developing the server-side API.  This is in its very
	  initial stages.  See serverapi.c and techdoc/api.txt

1998-08-02  Nathan Bryant  <bryant@cs.usm.maine.edu>
	* Makefile.in: added config_decls.h to dependencies

Sun Aug  2 21:09:09 EDT 1998 Nathan Bryant <bryant@cs.usm.maine.edu>
	* config_defs.h: renamed to config_decls.h
	* config.c, sysoputil.c: updated to reflect the above

Sun Aug  2 18:52:05 EDT 1998 Nathan Bryant <bryant@cs.usm.maine.edu>
	* config_defs.h: new file, contains external declarations from config.c
	* config.c: moved defs to config_defs.h, use PATH_MAX from <limits.h>
	  for bbs_home_directory
	* mailinglist.c, support.c: include <string.h>
	* sysoputil.c: include <string.h>, <limits.h>, "config_defs.h", remove
	  duplicated defs, replace gets() call with fgets()
	* user_ops.c: define _XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED

Sat Aug  1 18:32:52 EDT 1998 Nathan Bryant <bryant@cs.usm.maine.edu>
	* ipc_c_tcp.c: fixed order of memcpy parameters after gethostbyname

Sun Jul 19 17:26:12 EDT 1998 Nathan Bryant <bryant@cs.usm.maine.edu>
	* ChangeLog: reordered; the GNU standard is to add new entries to the
	  top.
	* .cvsignore: added userlist

Sun Jul 12 20:58:59 EDT 1998 Art Cancro <ajc@uncnsrd.mt-kisco.ny.us>
        * Finished migrating everything to the new data store.
        * Replaced the binary "calllog" with the ASCII "citadel.log"
        * Began converting broken utilities that depend on the old data store

Sat Jul 11 00:20:48 EDT 1998 Nathan Bryant <bryant@cs.usm.maine.edu>
	* Makefile.in: removed msgstats

Fri Jul 10 1998 Art Cancro <ajc@uncnsrd.mt-kisco.ny.us>
	* Initial CVS import
