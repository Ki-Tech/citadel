Basic:
- Connect to server and login (connects, gets "hello" and throws up window)
  * TODO: new user.  (need to understand registration)
- can log off (shows goodbye, and in application lets you connect to a
  different server)

* can't recieve express messages (GEXP style, will get all messages that
  are there.
* can't send and "reply" to express messages, uses either single or multi
  depending on server support.
* no who is online
- supports the IDEN command
- Automaticcaly goes to mail room if you have new messages
* can't change password or other config stuff


"main"
- Splits rooms up into new and no-new
- floor support
- rooms are now sorted

- Go to next room with messages
- go to any old room by double-clicking from list
* can't get to hidden or guessable-named rooms
* can't go to password protected rooms (tested)
* can't zap rooms
* can't list zapped rooms

"message"
- read new, all, or last-5 message in a room
- forward and  reverse
- enter messages in room (only type 0)
- handles Mail room
* doesn't say anything about having mail or going there first, just lists
  Mail in the "new" list.
* No reply button when in mail room.
- can see "next" and "prev" message.  (goes through the MSGS list which it
  gets when you first enter the room) no way to jump around (yet?).
- I update (via: SLRP) the user's "highest read" message everytime they
  read a message higher than the previous.  This changes the behavior from
  the text client, if you enter a room and read 2 new messages out of 5, then
  go to the next room, the three unread messages will still be unread with
  the java client while they wouldn't be with the text client.  I like it
  better personally, but hey, that's me.
* can't view room info

everything else isn't done.
