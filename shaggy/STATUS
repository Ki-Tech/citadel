Basic:
- Connect to server and login (connects, gets "hello" and throws up window)
  * TODO: new user.  (need to understand registration)
- can log off (shows goodbye, and in application lets you connect to a
  different server)

- can recieve express messages (GEXP style, though don't get for multiple
  messages yet)
- can send and "reply" to express messages, uses either single or multi
  depending on server support.
- who is online (double clicking on list will send express msg to user)

"main"
- Splits rooms up into new and no-new
 * limited floor support (shows in message panel)
 * doesn't sort the room names, even though there's "no pressing reason not to"

- Go to next room with messages
- go to any old room by double-clicking from list
 * can't get to hidden or guessable-named rooms
- can go to password protected rooms (untested)

"message"
- read new, all, or last-5 message in a room
- forward and 
- enter messages in room (only type 0)
 - handles Mail room, but 1) depends on the fact that the room is named
   "Mail" (ie: doesn't pass the flag returned from GOTO)
* doesn't say anything about having mail or going there first, just lists
  Mail in the "new" list.
* No reply button when in mail room.
- can see "next" and "prev" message.  (goes through the MSGS list which it
  gets when you first enter the room) no way to jump around (yet?).
- I update (via: SLRP) the user's "highest read" message everytime they
  read a message higher than the previous.  This changes the behavior from
  the text client, if you enter a room and read 2 new messages out of 5, then
  go to the next room, the three unread messages will still be unread with
  the java client while they wouldn't be with the text client.  I like it
  better personally, but hey, that's me.
- can view room info

everything else isn't done.
