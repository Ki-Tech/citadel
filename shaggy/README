Shaggy: java-powered citadel/ux client
by Will Schenk (chilly@alumni.psu.edu, chilly @ uncnsrd)

This is the java client.  It has been re-written to be multithreaded and to
use the JFC/Swing library.  You need Swing for this application to work;
either with Java > 1.1.3, or Java 1.2 (aka Java 2).

At the moment, my aim is just use this client to connect, so basically 
that means that I should get the client to do all the stuff that I use 
the bbs for.  'm sure that there are many features that I don't use, and 
so that'll give you an idea of where I'll need input: things like aide 
commands and editing configuration and other stuff I don't use.  :)

I've also run into some issues with non-obvious resolutions in how to
layout the gui and it's behavior.  Ideas are welcome.

I'll try and keep the STATUS file up-to-date with the current niftyness
of the features and lack thereof.

- BUILDING
I've including a copy of my "java make script", a perl script called "jmake".
Assuming javac is in your path and nothing funky is going on with your
$CLASSPATH, typing 

./jmake

should compile any java source files that are
newer than the corrosponding class files.  The "main" java file is
"citadel.java", so if you are concerned about anything being out of
whack,

javac -depend citadel.java

will build the main class, and recursively work down all the classes that
it references, so everything needed will be rebuilt.  (Contrast with jmake:
it builds all java classes in the directory, even those just hanging out
there having nothing to do with the citadel client.)

- RUNNING
At the moment there is no applet class, so it only works as an application.
The easiest way to run the client is:

java citadel [host]

where [host] is the optional network address of the server.  host defaults
to 127.0.0.1.  You'll have to change the code in net.java if you want it
to use a different port.

ideally, when it's distributed there should be either a zip or jar file
(both are actually zip files, only difference is the letters) with all the
classes.  This makes the applet load faster, and it's cleaner.

REMEMBER: if you are using java 1.1.x, you'll need to download the swing
libraries.  To use the libraries, you will need to put them in the
CLASSPATH environment variable, or pass them on the command line.  Remember
to put "." in the classpath.  

example:
export CLASSPATH=.:/usr/local/jdk/lib/classes.zip:/usr/local/swing/swingall.jar
