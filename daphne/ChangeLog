Revision 1.14  2000/01/08 20:06:38  smw
Added hosts.cpp (for user configurable bbs additions to bbslist)

Revision 1.13  2000/01/08 20:02:43  smw
Restabilized 'goto'.
Started adding support for adding your own list of BBSes to choose from.

Revision 1.12  1999/12/15 03:01:07  smw
Changed 'enter' so that it ONLY asks for a recipient when in mail.
Changed goto so that it no longer deletes the message window when clicked
on.  This results in a potential infinitate number of room menus, which
I'll fix when I have time.  This was the ONLY instability.  Previously
clicking on goto (in the menu, the arrow button OR the 'goto' button) more
than once would cause the program to crash.  That's no longer the case.
The *ix version is now stable.

Fixed various problems in the MSW version, which will be released only in
executable form when stabilized.

Revision 1.11  1999/11/15 05:22:11  smw
On disconnect, changed the SetStatusText() to "" for 1, and 2 to blank
the 2nd and 3rd status fields.  Also fixed zap again.  Replaced the
'zapped rooms' floor in the roomtree.cpp.

Revision 1.10  1999/11/15 05:05:13  smw
Added some checks for connectivity.  The roomview commands were locking
Daphne if the program wasn't connected.  Now it's not.  All nice and
stable.

Revision 1.9  1999/11/15 04:19:18  smw
Killed the refresh timer in who.cpp
Updated the who function so that refreshes are no longer automated, but
WILL work when clicking on 'refresh' on the who window.
who_refresh had a timer which wasn't stoppable, which would, when
connecting to another bbs, continue running and then core dump.
Removed the read new button from roomview.  It wasn't necessary as new
messages dump automatically.

Revision 1.8  1999/11/12 00:49:05  smw
Updated README.  Tweaked zip slightly.  Started mods for Chat and for
'reply to' mail.

Revision 1.7  1999/11/11 05:41:38  smw
Another zap tweak:  After zapping a room the user is taken directly to the
Lobby> and has to hit 'goto' to get to the next room.

Revision 1.6  1999/11/11 05:04:57  smw
Made a slight tweak to the default size of the button bar in roomview.cpp.
All the buttons (including the new 'zap' button) should show up by
default.

Revision 1.5  1999/11/11 04:42:28  smw
Made a minor tweak to zapped messages.  Now when you click on any room in
the roomtree the roomtree is deleted and reloaded.  This is so that when
you click on a room in the zapped list it'll come out, immediately.
Previously you either had to click on the folder itself, or log out and
in.

Revision 1.4  1999/11/11 04:32:00  smw
Set up 'zapped rooms' functionality.  Made tweaks so that zapped rooms
appear in the room tree.  Set up unzap capability.  If you click on a room
in the zapped rooms folder it will open in the room view screen.  Clicking
on the zapped rooms folder refreshes the room tree.  Added bitmaps for
goto and for disconnect.  Added a 'zap' button in the room view window.
Added disconnect features so the program will allow for closing a citadel
session and beginning another without shutting down.  Began working on
chat code and configurable citadel sessions (ie, clicking on connect
should prompt you for which bbs you want to go to.)

Revision 1.3  1999/11/11 04:28:29  smw
Updated make install so it works properly.

Revision 1.2  1999/11/07 18:42:52  smw
Removed all 'cout' commands
changed 'exit' commands to 'close' on the userlogin menu
updated daphne so that disconnecting from the server doesn't
shut down the program.

Revision 1.1  1999/11/07 17:56:38  ajc
* Began the ChangeLog for this project.
