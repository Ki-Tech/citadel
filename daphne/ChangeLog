 Revision 1.7  1999/11/11 05:41:38  smw
 Another zap tweak:  After zapping a room the user is taken directly to the
 Lobby> and has to hit 'goto' to get to the next room.

Revision 1.6  1999/11/11 05:04:57  smw
Made a slight tweak to the default size of the button bar in roomview.cpp.
All the buttons (including the new 'zap' button) should show up by
default.

Revision 1.5  1999/11/11 04:42:28  smw
Made a minor tweak to zapped messages.  Now when you click on any room in
the roomtree the roomtree is deleted and reloaded.  This is so that when
you click on a room in the zapped list it'll come out, immediately.
Previously you either had to click on the folder itself, or log out and
in.

Revision 1.4  1999/11/11 04:32:00  smw
Set up 'zapped rooms' functionality.  Made tweaks so that zapped rooms
appear in the room tree.  Set up unzap capability.  If you click on a room
in the zapped rooms folder it will open in the room view screen.  Clicking
on the zapped rooms folder refreshes the room tree.  Added bitmaps for
goto and for disconnect.  Added a 'zap' button in the room view window.
Added disconnect features so the program will allow for closing a citadel
session and beginning another without shutting down.  Began working on
chat code and configurable citadel sessions (ie, clicking on connect
should prompt you for which bbs you want to go to.)

Revision 1.3  1999/11/11 04:28:29  smw
Updated make install so it works properly.

Revision 1.2  1999/11/07 18:42:52  smw
Removed all 'cout' commands
changed 'exit' commands to 'close' on the userlogin menu
updated daphne so that disconnecting from the server doesn't
shut down the program.
