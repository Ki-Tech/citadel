 Revision 1.18  2003/11/18 04:58:34  ajc
 * Added ctdlelements.php ... this is to be used for functions which fetch
   Citadel protocol data and convert it to insertable HTML.
 * Implemented a first cut of a "read message" function.

 Revision 1.17  2003/11/14 17:15:19  ajc
 * Identify our message format preference (HTML followed by plain text)
   to the server upon connection, so MSG4 commands run properly.

 Revision 1.16  2003/11/14 17:09:04  ajc
 * Added a basic read loop ... currently only fetches message numbers

 Revision 1.15  2003/11/09 17:53:47  ajc
 * Moved all of the session-management code from ctdlheader.php to
   ctdlsession.php, leaving only a single function call.  This will
   hopefully make ctdlheader.php more palatable to non-programmers.

 Revision 1.14  2003/11/07 15:56:13  ajc
 * ctdlprotocol.php: known room list fetch now sets subscript "hasnewmsgs"
 * listrooms.php: render rooms with unseen messages in boldface

 Revision 1.13  2003/11/05 03:29:12  ajc
 * Added a room list function to the library
 * Threw together temporary room list and goto pages to demonstrate

 Revision 1.12  2003/11/04 19:17:16  ajc
 * Added an initial version of the goto command

 Revision 1.11  2003/11/03 05:32:57  ajc
 * Minor code cleanups
 * ctdl_mesg() now returns ready-to-output HTML to the caller, instead of
   outputting it itself.

 Revision 1.10  2003/11/02 05:35:11  ajc
 * who.php: added
 * ctdlprotocol.php: worked out a tentative data API using this function.

 Revision 1.9  2003/11/02 04:26:11  ajc
 * Cleaned up the pages in preparation for handing it off to the extremely
   talented developers and webmasters who will soon be working on it.

 Revision 1.8  2003/11/02 04:12:27  ajc
 * welcome.php: added.
 * do_login.php: reworked to provide a squeaky-clean transition to
   the welcome.php page.  welcome.php can now contain whatever the site's
   webmaster wants it to, without being clogged up with login code.

 Revision 1.7  2003/11/02 04:02:36  ajc
 * Firmed up the login/logout process
 * Don't allow load of pages other than login.php logout.php do_login.php
   if the session is not logged in.
 * Removed sessionproxy.c

 Revision 1.6  2003/11/02 02:39:30  ajc
 * Added a proper CVS ID and Copyright disclaimer to every file.  Other
   developers and webmasters working on the project, please add your own
   identities to the copyright notice of any module you work on.

 Revision 1.5  2003/11/01 23:29:04  ajc
 * Allow the session proxy to time out after 15 minutes.
 * This program now requires PHP v4.3.0 or newer due to bugs in the socket
   functions of PHP 4.1.  ctdlheader.php now enforces this.

 Revision 1.4  2003/11/01 06:12:20  ajc
 * Got login/logout working.  Still need to redirect unloggedin sessions to
   a login page.

 Revision 1.3  2003/11/01 05:10:49  ajc
 * When sending the QUIT command to the server, output a bunch more newlines
   so the session proxy has a chance to see that the Citadel server closed
   the connection.  This will make the proxy shut down as well.

 Revision 1.2  2003/10/31 05:03:46  ajc
 * Stabilized the session proxy
 * Added 100 mode text downloads
 * Print server hello banner

 Revision 1.1  2003/10/31 03:47:13  ajc
 * Initial CVS import
