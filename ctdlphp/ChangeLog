 Revision 1.7  2003/11/02 04:02:36  ajc
 * Firmed up the login/logout process
 * Don't allow load of pages other than login.php logout.php do_login.php
   if the session is not logged in.
 * Removed sessionproxy.c

 Revision 1.6  2003/11/02 02:39:30  ajc
 * Added a proper CVS ID and Copyright disclaimer to every file.  Other
   developers and webmasters working on the project, please add your own
   identities to the copyright notice of any module you work on.

 Revision 1.5  2003/11/01 23:29:04  ajc
 * Allow the session proxy to time out after 15 minutes.
 * This program now requires PHP v4.3.0 or newer due to bugs in the socket
   functions of PHP 4.1.  ctdlheader.php now enforces this.

 Revision 1.4  2003/11/01 06:12:20  ajc
 * Got login/logout working.  Still need to redirect unloggedin sessions to
   a login page.

 Revision 1.3  2003/11/01 05:10:49  ajc
 * When sending the QUIT command to the server, output a bunch more newlines
   so the session proxy has a chance to see that the Citadel server closed
   the connection.  This will make the proxy shut down as well.

 Revision 1.2  2003/10/31 05:03:46  ajc
 * Stabilized the session proxy
 * Added 100 mode text downloads
 * Print server hello banner

 Revision 1.1  2003/10/31 03:47:13  ajc
