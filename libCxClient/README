What is libCxClient?
--------------------
libCxClient is a framework which you can use to develop a Citadel/UX client.  It
also allows you to extend Citadel/UX functionality into an existing program,
like a mailbox analyser.

Who made libCxClient?
---------------------
The CxClient project was started by Brian C. Ledbetter <brian@shadowcom.net> in
October of 2000.  The project's scope has changed since then, and a part of the
resulting rethinking of the project caused the core functionality of a 
Citadel/UX client to be placed inside of a shared-library which can be used by
any program.  The libCxClient code was split off from the original CxClient (now
'infusion') project in January of 2001, and is maintained by the Citadel/UX
Development Team, a subset of the Citadel/UX Consortium.

How do I use libCxClient?
-------------------------
Please refer to the website for complete documentation of the libCxClient API,
along with example code (including working clients!).  libCxClient will not do
you any good by itself, unless you are a software developer who wishes to create
a Citadel/UX client.
