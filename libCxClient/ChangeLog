Revision 1.6  2001/02/22 17:05:19  brian
* Updated CxMsList() API to allow users to select only NEW messages, or only
the LAST x messages (<-skel).  THIS WILL REQUIRE CLIENT-SIDE CHANGES IN ORDER
FOR YOUR CLIENT TO WORK!

Revision 1.5  2001/02/19 14:50:58  brian
* Fixed problem in which unconnected clients send messages to file descriptor
0 (stdout), Now CxClSend() should do nothing if not connected.

Revision 1.4  2001/02/14 03:48:51  brian
* Added the NOTES file, containing some thoughts about the ASYN protocol,
eloquently elaborated upon by AJC (Ig).

Revision 1.3  2001/02/07 22:42:24  brian
* Removed ID tag.

Revision 1.2  2001/02/07 22:41:51  brian
* Updated ChangeLog to conform to Citadel/UX standards (kinda)  :)
