Revision 1.10  2001/05/14 14:01:22  brian
* Added multi-connection support.  libCxClient can now handle
multiple concurrent connections to different Citadel servers.
This, unfortunately, required a change in the development API.
Please examine the source in src/newtest.c for an example
of how to use the new API.
* Fixed some bugs in the transport layer.
* No new features that I can think of, but there may be some...

Revision 1.9  2001/03/13 22:45:53  brian
* Changed the return interface for CxMiExpRecv().  It now returns a more
intelligible struct representing an atomic Express Message.  UNfortunately,
this requires the user to free 2 things (object, object->message) as opposed
to one (object)...  C'est la vie...

Revision 1.8  2001/03/13 03:41:03  brian
* Added SLRP support (but doesn't seem to work yet...)

Revision 1.7  2001/02/22 17:14:12  brian
* Added MSGS_* flags to make using the new CxMsList() api easier to code for.

Revision 1.6  2001/02/22 17:05:19  brian
* Updated CxMsList() API to allow users to select only NEW messages, or only
the LAST x messages (<-skel).  THIS WILL REQUIRE CLIENT-SIDE CHANGES IN ORDER
FOR YOUR CLIENT TO WORK!

Revision 1.5  2001/02/19 14:50:58  brian
* Fixed problem in which unconnected clients send messages to file descriptor
0 (stdout), Now CxClSend() should do nothing if not connected.

Revision 1.4  2001/02/14 03:48:51  brian
* Added the NOTES file, containing some thoughts about the ASYN protocol,
eloquently elaborated upon by AJC (Ig).

Revision 1.3  2001/02/07 22:42:24  brian
* Removed ID tag.

Revision 1.2  2001/02/07 22:41:51  brian
* Updated ChangeLog to conform to Citadel/UX standards (kinda)  :)
