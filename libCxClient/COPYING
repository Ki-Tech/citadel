What are the Restrictions upon copying libCxClient?
---------------------------------------------------
Please refer to the LICENSE file for complete legal details on redistributing
the libCxClient program.

In plain english, this license means a few things:
	- Copying libCxClient shall be at no charge.
	- Creating works based upon libCxClient is allowed. *
	- Using libCxClient code in your projects is allowed. *

The nitty gritty is as such:  You can copy/redistribute this program at no 
charge, provided you keep the LICENSE file intact and present with the rest of
the source code.  Creating works based upon the libCxClient libraries is 
allowed, without any restrictions, whatsoever (no nagging notifications allowed,
no redistribution of your code is required).  It is even O.K. for you to take
portions of the code present under libCxClient and use it in commercial (non-
open-sourced) projects, but herein lies the catch: Any work based upon PORTIONS
OF libCxClient CODE (in other words, projects which directly compile libCxClient
into any portion of proprietary code, instead of using the libCxClient API 
copyrighted as specified in LICENSE) must MUST _MUST_ include the above copyright
notice in some portion of the documentation for the project, and the copyright
notice should be accessible to end-users of your project.  This ensures that,
even though you chose to use our code for your project, you still give us credit
where credit is due.

Why did we choose a BSD-like License?
-------------------------------------
The BSD-style license was chosen to promote the greatest level of freedom 
possible.  It is in this author's opinion that the GNU General Public License
contains too many restrictions on any code licensed underneath it, which, in
the end, prohibits productive use of licensed code.  I feel that the BSD
license allows developers to share ideas on a more free level, without having
to worry about whether or not they must redistribute portions of code, some
of which they may have worked on in the past.

If you don't think that the BSD license works, I refer you to products such
as Windows 9x/NT/2000 (which use portions of the 4.xBSD TCP/IP subsystem) and 
Internet Explorer (which uses portions of Mosaic).  These projects incorporated 
public-domain code into their codebase, but were not required to release ALL (or
ANY) of their code to the public as a result.  You will notice that appropriate
copyright notices can be found amongst the user documentation, though.

The BSD license works, for everyone.

(...and that's the end of my diatribe)
